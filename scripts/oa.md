### Summary

**Title:** Additive Archaeology: An Alternative Framework for Recontextualising Archaeological Entities

**Subject:** 3: grand disciplinary challenge, 2: real, virtual, and authentic are becoming increasingly unstable, 1: Additive manufacturin

**Key Themes:** 1: a radical new generative framework within which to recontextualise and reconsider the nature of archaeological entities specifically within the domain of digital archaeology, 1: avin Lucas’ characterisation of the archaeological record as a product of contending processes of materialisation and dematerialisation

**Key Literature:** 1: Lucas, G., Understanding the Archaeological Record, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2012.

**The Interesting Bits:**

<ul><li>Materialising the record: the material world is, at any given time, an archive of this process of (de)materialization” [3, p.205]</li><li>Materialising the record: Here, depositional processes (called containment or territorialisation) cohere to assemble, or gather, things in specific places</li><li>Materialising the record: Complimentary processes (called enchainment or coding) cohere to generate recurring associations such as typological similarities or repeated find combinations.</li><li>Materialising the record: the practices of the field archaeologist are not so much data collection but interventions, or material interactions, in which tools and procedures are mobilised locally to materialise new entities or artefacts (e.g. drawings, samples, photographs, context sheets, field diaries, finds and reports); it is these new, mobile, dynamic assemblages of autonomous objects that become archives.  </li><li>Materialising the record: he archaeological record as constructed in the present, also known as the archive.</li><li>Materialising the record: the first connotation is that of material culture, materiality or artefacts understood in their broadest sense</li><li>Materialising the record: next meaning is expressed in terms of how deposits and assemblages come to be, something he labels as “formation theory</li></ul>

### Tabular Representation
<table><tr><th>Observation</th><th>Resonances</th><th>Crossref</th><th>Problems</th></tr><tr><td>decisions are made in 'real' archives about what is kept, what is left out. </td><td>I wonder how far the metaphor of the 'archive' can be pushed before it breaks? Before it conceals more than it reveals?</td></tr>

<tr><td>'enchainment' is a cool word; seems to suggest an element of coercion, perhaps? This must be Lucas' term.</td></tr>
<tr><td>data are always constructed; the act of 'collecting' is also an act of creation. Here, it literally results in the creation of new material culture too.</td><td>Drucker</td><td>[DHQ](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html)</td><td>Problems:</td></tr>
