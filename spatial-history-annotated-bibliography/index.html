<p><strong>Akerman, James R. and Robert W. Karrow Jr. eds. <em>Maps: Finding Our Place in
the World</em>. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This collection of Essays accompanied an exhibit at the Field Museum in
Chicago and outlines the history of cartography while introducing the reader
to the history of maps. With text and visuals, the authors show the changes
and commonalities in how society has used and made maps over time. According
to the contributors, maps are intrinsically linked to the time and place in
which they were made-its social conventions, its political climate, and its
society. The collection poses many questions for cartographers and spatial
historians today, as well as great visual inspiration.</p>

<p><strong>Bailyn, Bernard, and Barbara DeWolfe. <em>Voyagers to the West: A Passage in
the Peopling of America on the Eve of the Revolution</em>. New York: Knopf,
1986.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bernard Bailyn’s Voyagers to the West (1986) won the author a second
Pulitzer Prize while emphasizing an explicit spatial argument in an
innovative Atlantic history perspective. On the very first page of Voyagers,
Bailyn emphasizes the importance of the great quantitative shift in the
number of immigrants arriving in the North American colonies at the same
time that the geographical extent of settlement suffered a considerable
expansion into the backcountry. The first chapter of the book is replete
with detailed analytical maps (showing patterns of settlement, not just
geographic accidents and “contextual” information) helping to underscore the
importance of this shift in the spatial pattern of settlement and its
attendant challenges to the British capacity for social control in the
colonies. Bailyn goes on in the remainder of the book to trace out
individual and collective destinies across the different spaces of the
colonies–taking care, in this way, to use the comparative method to suss out
the differences that geography made on spatial patterns of settlement and on
late colonial society in broad terms.</p>

<p><strong>Baker, Alan R. H. <em>Geography and History: Bridging the Divide</em>. Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 2003.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Baker presents an exhaustive review of the scholarship that has emerged at
the fertile intersection of the history and geography disciplines.
Acknowledging the tensions that have existed in years past between
historians and geographers, particularly where their research subjects
overlap, Baker nevertheless argues for the interdependence of the two
disciplines–that history cannot really be understood without incorporating
geography, and vice-versa. This is perhaps obvious, in one sense, but
historians and geographers do approach their work differently, creating
challenges for historical geographers and historians embracing the spatial
turn. However, the perspectives of history and geography ultimately
complement each other, and Baker provides an engaging background in these
perspectives and the prospects for continued explorations that bridge the
divide.</p>

<p><strong>Bodenhamer, David J., John Corrigan, and Trevor M. Harris. <em>The Spatial
Humanities: GIS and the Future of Humanities Scholarship</em>. Indiana University
Press, 2010.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is an edited volume of Essays by humanities scholars working with
space. It deals mostly with theoretical topics rather than case studies, for
example, “Turning Toward Place, Space, and Time” by Ed Ayers or “Qualitative
GIS and Emergent Semantics” by John Corrigan. The editors hope that spatial
humanities will “revitalize and redefine scholarship by (re)introducing
geographic concepts of space to the humanities.” The volume is a little
GIS-centric (perhaps necessarily), but does a good job of getting at issues
beyond just the discipline of history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Buisseret, David (ed.). <em>Envisioning the City: Six Studies in Urban
Cartography</em>. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Throughout their existence, the layered complexities of cities have
presented challenges to those who have sought to understand them. This
volume presents examples of cartographic approaches to understanding the
city and its future potential, ranging from ancient China, to Renaissance
Europe, to Burnham’s 1909 Plan of Chicago. What often emerges in these
examples are idealized representations of the cities, subject to the desires
of the map-makers and (especially) their patrons. These cartographic works,
then, shed light on the cultural and social contexts that produced them in
addition to the past urban forms represented.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Carter, Paul. <em>The Road to Botany Bay: An Exploration of Landscape and
History</em>. University Of Chicago Press, 1987.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paul Carter published The Road to Botany Bay as “an essay in spatial
history,” which outlines the historical process of space construction
through place-naming in Australian history. Of particular interest is
Chapter 1, in which Carter details how European explorers like Captain Cook
used naming to order the land they “discovered” into a narrative of imperial
exploration. Carter comes at it from a literary criticism approach, but it
is useful for historians interested in more theoretical discussion of how
place gets constructed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Cope, Meghan and Sarah Elwood, eds. <em>Qualitative GIS: A Mixed Methods
Approach</em>. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, 2009.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This slim volume is a collection of scholarly articles bookended by
introductory and concluding chapters by the editors. Targeting new
researchers, the stated aim of the book is “to frame the emerging field of
qualitative GIS, profiling the range of ways in which researchers and
practitioners are integrating GIS with qualitative research.” While
geographic information science technologies are quantitative tools, used to
process, interpret, and represent data, Cope and Elwood make a case for the
novel integration of these tools with qualitative skills, information, and
research questions. The combination of techniques, they argue, requires
ambitious and new methodologies that can deepen and shift our assumed
conceptual frameworks and observations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Cronon, William. <em>Nature’s Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West</em>. New
York: W.W. Norton, 1991.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>William Cronon’s Nature’s Metropolis is a tour de force of environmental,
economic, and cultural history framed by an explicitly spatial regional
perspective. The object of analysis, Chicago, is defined by its region, the
Great West, every bit as much as the growth of the city as a central place
comes to define the American Midwest. Cronon draws upon venerable ideas from
regional science in developing the argument of the book; in particular, the
author deploys the concept of cities as central places derived from the work
of Von Thünen. The book begins with transportation networks, observing both
the contingent character of Chicago’s rise (there were other possible
centers) as well as illuminating what would come to be seen as decisive
advantages. As networks of transport came to center on Chicago, so too did
the growing city become the center of markets for goods such as grain,
lumber, and meat. The spatial distribution of the production of these goods
throughout the Great West provides the critical linkage between economic and
environmental processes writ large and the specific configurations of
markets and systems of processing and exchange that arose in the city of
Chicago. In sum, Nature’s Metropolis is remarkably successful in merging the
analysis of spatial patterns, especially in terms of the city of Chicago and
its far flung hinterland, with the production of space (via markets and
technology) in temporal, that is, historical terms.</p>

<p><strong>Ethington, Philip J. “Placing the Past: ‘Groundwork’ for a Spatial Theory of
History.” <em>Rethinking History</em>. 11 (2007), 465-494, 2007.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This essay, accompanied by several responses and critiques from other
theorists, presents a dense but readable argument that time can only exist
as a “place” in history. Ethington does a thorough review of basic theories
of time and space, and critiques historians for paying too little attention
to space - and, in fact, to time (as a concept). He argues that time, being
often described using spatial metaphors (e.g. ahead, behind), is most
effectively represented spatially (and therefore cartographically). His
vision for a “vast multi-perspectival atlas of world history” is partially
realized by the Hypercities project at UCLA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fox, Jefferson, Ronald R. Rindfuss, Stephen J. Walsh, and Vinod Mishra eds.
<em>People and the Environment: Approaches for Linking Household and Community
Surveys to Remote Sensing and GIS</em>. Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers,
2003.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The studies presented in this volume highlight and advance the
interdisciplinary work done to link the fields of remote sensing and GIS
with the social sciences across multiple time and spatial scales. Looking at
humans as “agents of landscape change that shape and are shaped by the
landscape,” these papers attempt to carve out new theoretical frameworks and
practices to integrate quantitative data (e.g. remotely sensed data on land
use and land cover change) and qualitative data (e.g. community mapping
efforts or demographic surveys) into comprehensive, integrative stories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fyfe, David A., Deryck W. Holdsworth and Chris Weaver. “Historical GIS and
Visualization: Insights From Three Hotel Guest Registers in Central
Pennsylvania, 1888-1897.” <em>Social Science Computer Review</em>. Published online 8
April 2009.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using a custom-developed visualization environment (dubbed “HotelViz”),
these authors demonstrate the value of examining spatial and temporal
patterns together in a single interface. Using their application, they
combed through thousands of individual records from three hotels in 1880s
and 1890s, discovering spatial patterns that reflected types of business
travel, place hierarchy, and transportation corridors and temporal patterns
that reflected the periodicity of weekly, monthly, or seasonal journeys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hägerstrand, Torsten. “What about People in Regional Science?” <em>Papers of
the Regional Science Association</em> vol. 24, 1970, pp.7-21.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to shifting the attention of geographers to a focus on the
behavior of individuals, this seminal article is credited as one of the
first to articulate a theory of “time geography.” The central notion of this
theory was that time and space are limited resources, and people behave
according to these constraints to realize projects. Hagerstrand innovated
the use of a visualization methods including space-time maps that allow one
to plot an individuals path through time (with time as a third dimension)
and space-time prisms that illustrate the opportunities and constraints of
an individual in space and time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Harmon, Katherine. <em>You Are Here: Personal Geographies and Other Maps of the
Imagination</em>. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2004.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Harmon has collected hundreds of maps of real and imagined places to form a
beautiful look at how cartography and spatial analysis add another dimension
of how one views the world. Many of the maps are imaginary: maps of one’s
mind, of a memory, of fictional cities and places, of the path to heaven or
hell. Others are more speculative, like maps of the American west before
explorers crossed the continent. Harmon’s book is a reminder that maps and
cartography can be as insightful and beautiful as they are informative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Knowles, Anne K. <em>Placing History: How Maps, Spatial Data, and GIS Are
Changing Historical Scholarship</em>. Redlands, Cal.: ESRI Press, 2008.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Placing History is a collection of Essays that reflect on the value of GIS
for research in history and historical geography. With contributions by some
of the leading historians and geographers, the book capture the depth and
breadth of the current thinking and practical use of GIS for history (in
2008). It reveals the variety of methodological approaches to using GIS in
different disciplines, and the case studies presented provide readers a
clear path to engage GIS in their own work. The book is accompanied by a
CD-ROM that includes data, basic instructions on how to use GIS, and
supplementary PowerPoint presentations from authors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>MacEachren, Alan M. <em>Some Truth With Maps: A Primer on Symbolization &amp;
Design</em>. Washington, D.C.: Association of American Geographers, 1994.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Written in part as a response to Mark Monmonier’s popular and incisive How
to Lie With Maps (1991), MacEachren seeks to distill best practices in
geographic visualization for a growing audience of GIS users without formal
cartographic training. The concepts and methods presented reduce the
susceptibility to be unknowingly misled by on-screen displays of data. Of
especial value are MacEachren’s discussions of best practices for data
exploration, and how to acknowledge, integrate, and symbolize uncertainty in
geographic information. Even today the representation of uncertainty remains
a thorny problem, lending continued relevance to this work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Mitchell, Timothy. <em>Rule of Experts: Egypt, Techno-Politics, Modernity</em>.
Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the vein of colonial and post-colonial studies, Timothy Mitchell uses
space as a category of analysis in both senses of spatial history: space as
a key variable in historical analysis; historical analysis as a critical
element in describing the conceptual spaces of colonialism and modernity in
Egypt. For instance, in Rule of Experts, Mitchell devotes the first chapter
to an innovative exploration of the interplay between forces of modernity
(dams, railroads, capitalist agriculture, wars) and the creation of a new
spatial order in which the Anopheles gambiae mosquito moved into Egypt,
caused an epidemic of malaria, and in so doing generated a whole new series
of institutions and practices associated with vector control. In this way,
Mitchell uses spatial patterns to help explain the unfolding of a particular
historical episode and to draw together, under the rubric of spatial
connections, the many disparate threads of the story of the mosquito in
Egypt. He also points to the way historical data, read from a certain point
of view, provide evidence for arguments about more universal themes, such as
the space of capitalist modernity in colonial settings.</p>

<p><strong>Moellering, Harold. “The Potential Uses of a Computer Animated Film in the
Analysis of Geographical Patterns in Crashes.” <em>Accident Analysis and
Prevention</em> (1976) 8: 215-227.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This pioneering work imagined the potential of revealing patterns in
geographic data with animated displays long before developments in personal
computers made such analyses practical for widespread use. Moellering’s
significant innovation was his manipulation of the temporal element of the
data. When viewed with a conventional timeline, three years of traffic
accidents in Detroit had little discernible pattern, leading one to believe
the phenomenon was essentially random. Moellering provided a complementary
view that combined the accidents into 15-minute time slices and arranged
them into a “composite week,” in which the frame for “11:15 am to 11:30 am,
Tuesday,” displayed all accidents that happened during that time of the week
across the three-year dataset. Reorganizing the temporal data in this way
revealed times of the day, and days of the week more susceptible to
accidents, in addition to particularly troublesome locations in the network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Moretti, Franco. <em>Atlas of the European Novel 1800-1900</em>. London and New
York: Verso, 1999.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900 presents a unique and inspiring way
of relating literature and geography. Through a series of simple, but
information and idea-rich maps, Moretti describes the real and imagined
places of individual novels and collections of novels. Ultimately, Moretti
reveals the overlooked role of geography (both fictional and real) and ideas
of geography (what is a boundary, periphery, spatial taboo, linear) on
novels’ narratives. He shows this convincingly both in general–how geography
guides literary forms–and specifically–how plots self-organize and cohere
around spaces and places. The book is a pleasurable and creative
interleaving of prose, quotation, map, and caption.</p>

<p><strong>Mundy, Barbara E. “Mapping the Aztec Capital: The 1524 Nuremberg Map of
Tenochtitlan, Its Sources and Meanings.” <em>Imago Mundi</em> 50 (1998): 11-33.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a wonderful article that analyzes a famous early modern map with an
eye towards critical cartography. Mundy’s subject is a 1524 map of
Tenochtitlan, long one of the most recognizable maps of the early Spanish
conquistador era in Mesoamerica. Instead of a European map, Mundy
convincingly argues that the map was based on Aztec cartographic knowledge.
Mundy’s essay is, at its heart, an historical detective story that
meticulously leads the reader through different indigenous elements of the
map. Mundy reveals a cartographic skeleton of Aztec cosmology within the
Tenochtitlan map. For example, by representing the city in a more uniform
shape than its geographic reality, the map reflected a worldview that placed
Tenochtitlan at its spiritual center. Like a lawyer amassing evidence for
her case, Mundy carefully builds an argument that catapults indigenous
cartographic knowledge to the forefront of the Tenochtitlan map.</p>

<p><strong>Rae, Douglas. <em>City: Urbanism and its End</em>. New Haven: Yale University
Press, 2003.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this book, Douglas Rae explores the historical processes that gave rise
to the “centered” industrial city and then, over time, dismantled that same
space. The setting is New Haven, Connecticut, and the time period runs
roughly from the late 1800s through the 1990s. Rae employs spatial analysis
in several ways throughout the book. Notably, he geocodes the addresses of
businessmen, workers, politicians, and members of the “civic fauna” and
discovers patterns and trajectories of change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Reséndez, Andrés. <em>Changing National Identities at the Frontier: Texas and
New Mexico, 1800-1850</em>. Cambridge University Press, 2004.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although not explicitly a work of spatial history, Andrés Reséndez’s study
of identity-formation incorporates strong themes of spatiality. He examines
how people living at the border of Texas/New Mexico and Mexico during the
early 19th century were faced with a range of choices in how to construct
their national identity (Spanish, Mexican, American, Texan, Indian, etc.)
within a geographical imagination. Reséndez also describes the incredibly
fluid boundaries between different geographic entities at the time, along
with how larger structural forces (particularly the Mexican state and the
American market) impacted identity and spatial imagination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Schulten, Susan. “The Cartography of Slavery and the Authority of
Statistics.” <em>Civil War History</em>, vol. 56 no. 1, March 2010.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abraham Lincoln reportedly studied for hours a map of the slave population
in the American south. The U.S. Coast Survey map collected 1860 census data
into an effective heat map of the southern states. In this article, Schulten
explains the significance of this map and others like it, as the map was one
of the earliest instances of the graphic display of census data. Schulten
argues that the maps were essentially nationalistic propaganda for the
Union, as it justified the difference between the north and the south in a
scientific, statistical medium. She goes on to detail other ways in which
maps, charts, and the visual display of statistics helped shape American
politics and thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Self, Robert O. <em>American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for Postwar
Oakland</em>. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Self traces “the overdevelopment of suburbs and the underdevelopment of
cities” from the 1940s through the 1970s, using California’s East Bay as his
case study. The book works on two levels. First, as a history of political
culture in the postwar period, it looks at the struggle of African Americans
for rights and power, as well as at the politics of suburban city building.
Second, and more importantly for this bibliography, it is a “history of
space,” treating the ways space is carved up by ownership (“space as
property”), by metaphorical meanings (“space as social imagination”), and by
governmental entities (“space as political scale”). Self ultimately brings
these two levels together, showing how radical Black political movements
such as the Black Panthers, and conservative white movements such as
Proposition 13, had roots that can be mapped onto the same metropolitan
space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Sonlit, Rebecca. <em>Infinite City: A San Francisco Atlas</em>. Berkeley:
University of California Press, 2010.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a series of maps accompanied by short Essays, Solnit and ten other
writers describe particular experiences of San Francisco’s past and present.
Most use a familiar base map, oriented north-south with major roads and
landmarks. But the places mapped are unexpected: the “lost world” of South
of Market, 1960, before redevelopment; the “Third Street phantom coast”
showing the current and former bay shoreline from China Basin to Candlestick
Point, including former Chinese fishing villages, Butchertown, bygone
breweries and race tracks; “Shipyards and Sounds” showing African American
nightclubs and workplaces since World War II. This book seems more like
homage than model, but the maps and text work together to show that where
history took place matters as much as when it took place.</p>

<p><strong>Thomas, William G. and Edward L. Ayers. “The Differences Slavery Made: A
Close Analysis of Two American Communities.” <em>American Historical Review</em>
108:3, 2003, pp. 1299-1307.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Valley of the Shadow Project, created by Edward Ayres and William
Thomas, is a pioneering digital history focused on the histories of two
communities in the Shenandoah Valley, one in Pennsylvania and the other in
Virginia, around the time of the Civil War. Particularly significant, with
respect to Ayers and Thomas’s project, is the fact that it appeared in
print, in the American Historical Review, as well as online in an
interactive digital archive maintained by the University of Virginia’s
Center for Digital History. (An Overview: The Differences Slavery Made: A
Close Analysis of Two American Communities, AHR 108:3, 2003, pp. 1299-1307)
The online portion included maps created with GIS software portraying
important environmental, demographic, social and economic patterns in the
two communities. By placing the Augusta and Franklin counties side-by-side,
the Valley of the Shadow project used GIS to put forward an argument about
the fundamental commonalities found in these two communities divided by the
institution of slavery. Clearly, the argument about the common patterns of
life, except for slavery was substantially strengthened with the addition of
detailed spatial information: seeing these patterns, with one’s own eyes in
the carefully constructed pairings of maps provided by the authors, provides
the kind of empirical confirmation that text alone would struggle to
achieve. (The online version of the AHR article is located at:

<p><strong>Tobler, W. and S. Wineburg. “A Cappadocian Speculation.” <em>Nature</em> 231: 39-41
(May 7, 1971).</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is an interesting work that sought to deduce lost archeological town
sites from scant evidence. Tobler and Wineburg built a network from the
paired mentions of town names on cuneiform tablets, reasoning that towns
mentioned more often should have larger populations, and that towns
mentioned together more often are closer to each other. These two key
assumptions, derived from the gravity model, comprise the logic of the
resulting network of speculative town sites. Though the work did not succeed
in pinning down exact locations for these sites (the authors suggest the
average error in their calculations to be roughly 50km), it’s a daring and
innovative spatial analysis of archeological source data.</p>

<p><strong>Tufte, Edward R. <em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>. Second
Ed. Cheshire, Conn.: Graphics Press, 2007.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information details the importance of
visualization in understanding and interpreting statistical data. Tufte book
discusses many disciplines, but highlights several historical and map-based
graphics as among the best statistical graphics ever drawn. Among them is
Charles Joseph Minard’s six-variable 1869 map of the fate of Napoleon’s army
in Russia. Tufte’s book provides great inspiration for visualizations, and
provides a theoretical explanation for what makes good visualizations
usable, and bad visualizations difficult to read.</p>

<p><strong>Wood, Denis. <em>Everything Sings: Maps for a Narrative Atlas</em>. Los Angeles:
Siglio, 2010.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wood is the author of a pioneering work in “new cartography,” The Power of
Maps (1992), Making Maps: A Visual Guide to GIS (2005, 2011), and several
other influential works in cartography.</p>

  <p>This book however is a very personal set of maps of the author’s home
neighborhood in Raleigh, made with the assistance of students in the School
of Design at NC State University over a thirty-year period. These include a
map of Jack O’ Lanterns, paths of buses, postal carriers, and paperboys and
street trees by size. All are based on-require-personal observation of
essential but fleeting experience. Wood argues the sum of such observations
is the essence of his neighborhood.</p>

  <p>Ira Glass introduces the maps this way: “They describe human lives without
ever showing us any people… Wood is writing a novel where we never meet
the main characters, but their stuff is everywhere… Their lives seem far
away and utterly present, both at the same time. Which somehow makes our
world seem fragile and very precious. Maybe it is just me, but that seems
like the opposite of the feeling ordinary maps give us, with their rock
solid facts and their obsession with street names. They make the world seem
anything but fragile.”</p>
