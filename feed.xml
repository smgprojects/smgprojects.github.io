&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;experimenting-with-a-recurrent-neural-network-package&quot;&gt;experimenting with a recurrent neural network package&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-was-trying-to-do&quot;&gt;what I was trying to do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was curious to figure out if I could train the computer to write an Indiana Jones script. To do this, you put together a file to show the computer what such a script looks like. This is the ‘training’ file, or the input.txt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I googled until I found the scripts. I used Raiders, Temple of Doom, and Last Crusade&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reading the documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn&quot;&gt;char-rnn&lt;/a&gt; I realized that was too small, so I added Goonies and the Brendan Frasier Mummy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-did&quot;&gt;what I did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I followed the instructions at https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn to download and install the char-rnn package&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the last instruction, about sourcing, I had to re-run when I logged back into dhbox&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;today’s history.txt file is &lt;a href=&quot;june21-todays-history-file.txt&quot;&gt;june21-todays-history-file.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-that-were-hard&quot;&gt;things that were hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;getting the data. I went to gist.github.com and made a file, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/shawngraham/af1edaa5b40be09d643a4700bb2150af&quot;&gt;input.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I used curl to download it to the data folder, but had to find the ‘raw’ version, otherwise i just got the html that wraps the gist page. Raw version is behind the raw button on the page, [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/shawngraham/af1edaa5b40be09d643a4700bb2150af/raw/14c6a48715f20725256b9b2ccd13eeb3a3372fcd/input.txt]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trained the rnn with this command: &lt;code&gt;th train.lua -data_dir data/input.txt -rnn_size 512 -num_layers 2 -dropout 0.5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;came back the next day, when it finished running (which is today). Had to enter the source command again before dhbox remembered where torch was installed - i cd’d into the torch folder to do that&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‘sampled’ the model - this runs the generate-a-new-script thing &lt;code&gt;th sample.lua cv/some_checkpoint.t7 -gpuid -1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;had to ls the cv folder so I would know the file name for the last checkpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this printed the result to the screen; to do it to a file I added the &amp;gt; filename thing: &lt;code&gt;th sample.lua cv/some_checkpoint.t7 -gpuid -1 &amp;gt; script.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thoughts-on-where-to-go-next&quot;&gt;thoughts on where to go next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this ends the example. You could link to annotations you made, things you’ve seen, work that this entry is in dialog with, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note what is in this repo: a description of what I was up to; the results of my &lt;code&gt;$ history &amp;gt; todayshistory.txt&lt;/code&gt; command, the output of what I was trying to do, links to other things I used/created in the course of the experiment. You can make one repo with many folders, or many repos of just one folder, but whatever you do, try to keep everything together in a logical manner.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>nile diary plan</title>
        <description>&lt;ul id=&quot;markdown-toc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ideas&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-ideas&quot;&gt;Ideas?&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-would-any-of-this-mean-do-imply&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-what-would-any-of-this-mean-do-imply&quot;&gt;what would any of this mean? do? imply?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a nutshell:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** DH the shit out of this**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ideas&quot;&gt;Ideas?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;initial idea was just a test of &lt;a href=&quot;http://transkribus.edu&quot;&gt;transkribus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;resource is extremely rich though&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;topic models over space/time: some kind of choropleth?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;find more such diaries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Micropasts, crowdsource corrections to my transcription, get more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;wordvectors: her perceptions of ‘others’; her perception of ‘the past’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RNN: what is the platonic ideal type for her diary, for others? What would a machine written journey look like? what would a machine written journey tell us?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neatline; map the journey, link into the things she tells us (art works, churches, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;possible to find other diaries of people in roughly the same time, place? competing views?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twine game, built around her journey (her stuff gets stolen, rifled through on a number of occasions: the player character, perhaps…)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sonification of the data models; sonification of key words/phrases a la sonification of punctuation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-would-any-of-this-mean-do-imply&quot;&gt;what would any of this mean? do? imply?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the $0.64 question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;editors-note&quot;&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am interested in this diary because - eventually - the author spends time in Rome and Pompeii. I am also interested to see what her impression is of the Nile, its antiquities and its people. From a methodological point of view, I am also transcribing this diary to learn how to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/&quot;&gt;Transcribus&lt;/a&gt;, an environment that uses machine learning to -eventually- learn how to OCR the handwriting. Some of its (Transkribus’) features include automatic line detection, which is great for moving through the transcription methodically. Transkribus will also export the transcription as TEI, or as text embedded in the pdf, or as a Word doc. It doesn’t do markdown. It also doesn’t seem to export a space at the end of a line of text, and so you get words mushed where there should be line breaks. Finally, I was also interested in pushing this through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elotroalex/ed&quot;&gt;‘Ed’&lt;/a&gt;, but I kept getting weird kramdown errors and I figured, bah, just put it in my notebook. As always, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypothes.is&quot;&gt;Hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt; is enabled to allow me to mark up and link outwards to other kinds of information. Yes, I could do that in the text too, but I like the Hypothesis api.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;august-1874&quot;&gt;August 1874&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aug. 22 - 1874&lt;/strong&gt;. Left New York in Cunard steamer Algeria David, George, Bruce, D. W. Bishop and Ella Barrett with Augusta (the laundress) to see us off - a rainy day. D. W. Bishop introduced us toMr. Brown of Yorkshire, and to Mr. Smith, a Presb. clergyman of Lenox whowith his family was going to his native Scotland. Capt. read serviceon Sunday morning - in afternoon dead body of whale white, andshiny quite near us upon the water and hundreds of little birds uponit. The first half of voyage had smooth sea, mild temperature,and head winds. Saw a number of vessels. The second sundaymorning found the sea running high (it had been quite roughfor a couple of days) suddenly a great wave rose ten feetabove the deck and came down upon it knocking downevery one before it, C. among the number and came downthe gangway and into all the deck staterooms to the depthof five or six inches, setting all moveable things, trunks, etcafloat. I sat up on my couch and held on to my trunk and to C’schair that they might not go out and obstruct the passage ways.This was shortly before 10. A.M. After a time C. waded downto me with her shoes in her hand to report herself all soundbut drenched. Lunch was served at noon, and soon afterthe stewards had succeed in getting the water out of the
room sufficiently for C. to change her dress and for us tolook into my trunk. Everything below the trays had to bewrung out and hung up! On Sunday night a woman in the steerage died of heart defects. The wave was not the causethey were not at all wet there. The following night she wasburied at sea, the Capt. and Dr. being present. Tuesday at 2 P.M. landed passengers at Queenstown, having goneup into the harbor farther than I had ever been before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;september-1874&quot;&gt;September 1874&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept 2&lt;/strong&gt; - Wednesay at 8 A.M. stopped at the bar of the Merseyfor four hours for the tide. Finally stopped about 2 P.Mcustoms house officers and mr. Sherlock came on board.We were at the Adelphi where Mr. Sherlock had engagedrooms for us at 3 1/2 P.M. Among our passengers we hadbecome more particularly acquainted with there with us atthe Captain’s talbe Mrs. Larisson and daughter of Baltimore and her niece Miss Patterson, (great nice of Mr Mrs Bonapart)Mr. Yarnall of Philadelphia, going out to meet his wife and children in England - Mr. Jaqueneot a silk merchant 25 years old, native of Genoa, but living 6 years or morein Japan full of life and lafter - a Scotch lawyer opposite -Mr. Middleton, half Italian, half English, a most refined and cultivated young gentleman. He was baptized by PopeGregory 16, has an uncle a cardinal, and a great grand father’s headwas hung under London Bridge for being a Jacobite. Therewas also a Mr. and Mrs. Macklin, a most devoted couple who had a room opposite ours. After dinner walked to Brown’s Librarybut had not long to remain, the Egyptian collection lookedinteresting. Stepped into the great Northern Hotel - bough thei…critable piece of camphor. I did not have any letters towrite as I had written to all the family from Queenstown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 3&lt;/strong&gt; Thursday. Had been most comfortable at the Adelphi.Left room after 9 a.m. in the London and North Western. The countrylooked brown and autumnal. At E. Sq. Station saw six cor….s chained together Reached Euston Sq. station 2.30 P.M.Are at Bracon’s Hoetel, 21 Dover st. Piccadilly. A rainy afternoonvery tired, did not go out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 4&lt;/strong&gt; Friday. A rainy day went about noon to theKensington Museum. Met directly Miss Carter of Ireland,one of our fellow passengers who showed us the drawings ofthe students, one of her own among them very prettilycoloured, a fruit piece. A course of frut is gone through beforethey are allowed to go to the human figure. Took our lunch in the grill room. The wall in …. representing the month and seasons, stained glass window of Fox and Grafer. At oneend is a great range with a very large gridiron, and the steakor chop the only things furnished there are cooked before youreyes and serve quite hot and nice. Opening out of this is theDining room where cut from the joint etc are served. We went through the picture gallery, Resa…. galleries, and the Loancoolection which is very beautiful particularly in enamels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 5&lt;/strong&gt; Saturday. Walked over to Regents Quadrant, and downRegent at 20 Carleton Terrace. C. spoke to one of the men whohave fruit stalls behind the terrace at the end of St James Park - hisgreat grand father had had the stall originally. He had a cowthere too so as to sell fresh milk. Bought guide books for Egyptat Stanfords and …. map of London at Smiths. Lunched atCharing Cross Station, noisy and confused. Strolled to the VictoriaEmbankment and sat down in garden by Charing Cross Bridge. Herestill stands the old water gate of York House. Visited NationalGallery - notice the Turners, and took cab home. Found ourtrunks by the goods train had arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 6.&lt;/strong&gt; Sunday All Saints Margaret st. reachedthere late, a fi… seat, ch.. absent on holliday - wretched sermon. Church beautiful. A cold rainy day, did not go out again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 7&lt;/strong&gt; - Monday - Next to St Pauls - entered by door at endwhich is much more impressive than side entrace. A chapel on theleft hand is filled up much in Roman Catholic style. Thework of decorating dome etc progresses very slowly. Brassmural tablets have been erected to the memory of the officers andmen who perished by the capsizing of the Captain off CapeFinisterre in 1870. The tonnage or construction of the vessel had beenchanged while building and the Captian had not be modified. This isperperly set forth in the memorial. Took lunch and spent the restof the day in Bethnell Green Museum and wonderfully beautifulcollection of pictures etc. On leaving I went a little way into VictoriaPark - returning xxxxx Lunatic Asylum, Holborn Valley Viaduct, NewMetropolitan Market with its handsome iron gates and street runningunder it. Somewhere a house with slab inserted to show that Drydenlived there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 8&lt;/strong&gt; - Tuesday. Went to Dr. Reynolds - every thing very tastefuldrawings, fern cakes, Scotch grey xxxxx. He had nothing different tosay except to approve of our sojurn in Egypt. Mrs. O’Sullivanand Mrs. Landen out of town, left cards. Went to the Grill roomfor lunch, went into the International Gallery - pictures modern and quite interesting - the garden fine - heard organ in AlbertHall and crossed Hyde Park to see Albert memorial veryfine and grand. In the evening had a very pleasant visitfrom Mr. Middleton who brought a beautiful collection ofgold coins to show us. He took C’s watch to be repaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept 9&lt;/strong&gt; - Wednesday. Went out a pouring rain and boughtsome fruit for lunch. Mr. M. came for lunch at 12.30 and then wewent out in brougham to Westminster Abbey. He got the key,of some places there not generally shown to the public. Wewent up a narrow winding room stone stairs behindthe chapel of Edward the Confessor into an upper roomwhere prayers were said for the soul of Henry 5th hishelmet, shiled, and saddle of the armour that her wore atAgincourt were on a beam above, they probablywould not bear handling. He showed us someother places of this sort used for praying for somedeparted one in particular. He opened another littledoor a wooden stairs to the same sort of little roomwhere were effigies of distinguished persons dressed in the clothes they had worn in life- these very effigieswere carried in the funeral procession. There were Charles 2nd in beautiful lace and velvet, Queen Elizabeth frightfully ugly,Lord Nelson. The Duke of Buckingham (George Villiers) wasrepresented as lying dead, all the others as standing and alive. Agreat quantity of mock jewelry decorated them all, but they wore their own clothes and superb real lace. In a closet were the mannikinswith out any faces or dresses. Saw the wooden box containing thebones of Major Andre. In a side chapel on one side is a recent bustof the late F. D. Maurice where it seems strangely out of place. Noticedthe very beautiful iron work enclosing the tombe of Henry 7. Went intohist beautiful chapel, superb roof, banners of the knights of the order ofthe Bath, no banners are added but a new brass plate is put infor each new knight. No one is allowed to go upon the roofthe ceiling is considered so insecure. We went into theChapter House a very beautiful octagonal room with largelofty windows a high roo with one beatuiful marble columb in the centre - the original fine tile floor. Theyhave it practically covered with matting to preserve it. In thechapel of Ed. the Confessor near the entrance Mr. M. drew a boltin the floor and showed us a bit about 10 in by 5 of the original mosaicpavement. In the cloisters some composition has been putover the roof and carvings to preserve them as they were allcrumbling away. He pointed out some of the new purchased at the National Gallery - fine old pictures and wonderful prices.One by                 is so much retouched that they talk of having it cleaned to come down to the original He broughtus a guide book to London a hundred years ago to look at.Among the coins he brought was one of silver of Queen Elizabethmade so old and ugly that she ordered them all destoryed, abouta third of this has been cut off, but the head it left entire. Thisis the only one know to exist. The British Museum offered him [pounds] 60 for it which he declined but has left it to the Museum in his will. After he left us I bought this book etc. Miss Carymade us a very agreeable visit in the evening. She toldus that it has been quite the fashion this summer to makeexcursions in the environs in certain six horse coaches, whichare often driven by the owners, gentlemen, sometimes peersof the realm. They start from the White Horse cellars also by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 10&lt;/strong&gt; - Thursday. To Northumberland House,Trafalgar Square which is entirely dismantled, every thingmoveable gone even to the mantels and the timbers, stone, doorwindows stair cases etc are being sold at auction. TheBallroom and Pompeian room must have been superb.The kitchen, offices, pantries, and the arrangements for the servants are on a very extensive scale. The building is palatial, and when the garden ran down to the Thames itmust have been superb. Drove to the Victoria Station, luncheon,and went by train 1/2 hr to Dulwich, where a ten minutes walkbrought us to the gallery - free - the Murillo’s and Cuyp’s areparticularly fine. The Murillo’s Madonna of the Rosary is here,his Flower Girl and Peasant Boys. Rembrandt’s Little ServingMaid looking out of a window is very attractive. Other finepcitures by other artists. Had to wait a while for the train.Sydenham is but a very little farther.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 11&lt;/strong&gt; - Friday. Mr. M. lunched with us again. We wentin the brougham to the Foreign Office, a superbe new building - built around four side of a large quadrangle, on this interiorcourt statues and bust ornament the walls of the building. Thestaircase is magnificent entirely of mrables of the countrywhe wh of the balustrade is of dove colored marble perhaps 10 inwide, side walls painted on the plaster in excellent lathcoloring fine. The room for the reception of ambassadors iselegant, but they have retained the old fireplace which istoo insignificant for this fine room. The dining roomadjoining is spacious and elegant here they have retained the old mahogany furniture which is not much xxxx. Passedinto the India Office which was built before this and is notnearly so fine. Saw some carved slabs from India undera glass roof. At the British Museum saw some of thecoins and intaglios some of the latter very fine and costly. Inthe same room is the Etruscan jewelry bought fromCastellani for which together with the bronzes the Museumgave [pounds]20 000. Among these bronzes is a life size headof Minirva very beautiful, the back of the head filled inwith wood- a little figure about 8 in. high which haddiamond eyes - could not get near this as the room wasbeing cleaned. mr. M. by some magic took us intothe room where are the manuscripts and wrote an order fortwo which were brought, also a sack to put them onthey had belonged to the Dukes of Norfolk and were bequeathedby one of them to the Museum the first was of the 13th centurythe last a volume of a Bible was of the 14th, very finelyexecuted, a miniature of about 3 1/2 in by 4 1/2 on almostevery leaf the back rounds of these were of a very richdiaper patterns often showing the Dukes arms as ifwas painted for Lxxx of course they were on vellum. There can be very few manuscripts as fine as this. For oneof the cases outside is a part of the Magna Charta, which someone rescued from a sailor just as he was going to cut it intopatterns. Next into the reading room an immense circularroom lighted from the top with every convenience- books ofreference line the walls all around - the real library isshut off in numerous small room and every quarter hour atruck of books is wheeled in that has been ordered the previousquarter. Mr. M. told us that the sale of the NorthumberlandHouse brought only [pounds] 5000, the government gave [pounds] 100,000 for thehouse and I think [pounds] 156,000 more for the grounds. The Governmentcompelled the Duke to sell it as it is planned to run a finestreet through there. After parting with Mr. M. we went to theDeré gallery where we found Mr. and Mrs. Pjee Ronalds en routefor home; but as Mr. R is not well at present it is probable thatthey will remain this side. They told us of the death of Mr. Ad. Thomas.Passed the evening very agreeably in the Cary’s parlor, MrsLeRoy was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 12&lt;/strong&gt; - Saturday. Called at St. George’s Albemarle st. to seeif Mrs. L. Spencer might be there - walked up New Bond st. stoppedinto Phillip’s China shop. For Solon’s cameo’s about 10 in by 5 in he asked from       to 35 figureines. There is only one of eachsubject no duplicates of his work and he is employed by N….In this respect his work is like pictures. A tea set bought by a N. S. lady was 55 guineas - it consists of 18 cups and saucer 2 cakeplates and a slp bowl. Tiffany has some single cups of it jolanderpattern rich brown and gold grass and birds on white ground linedwith pink. The Artistic Grey stone ware is made in Londonand called Doulton Pottery. Looked for books about Egypt.Went to our bankers and to enquire for Alston, then to theBethnall Green Museum, looked principally at the FrenchSchool of paintings which is very fine rich in Meissoniers,Vernels, Decamps, Greuze etc. Some very few Raynolds,and Lawrence’s.

The Officiating Priests were dressed in a sortof pale brown robes trimmed with red. He who carried thechalice seemed to wave it in the form of a cross before presenting it to each person - when we first entered we saw afew men go to the altar and when they had commensied file off ontheir side, when they had finished a few more women ear - thecheri was fine - the service seemed impressive. The church verytasteful and rich in its decorations, beautiful marbles, some tileand bricks of various colrs are introduced with good effect. Therestaurants being closed wwe lunched at home and walkedto Westminster Abbey and though we arrived there 15 minutesbefore the hour specified every seat where one could hope to hearwith comfort was filled. Made several ineffectual attempts andlooked around during most of the service - stood and heard a fewwords towards the end of the sermon. Saw Mr. Lewis Rutherford there.After walking around the equestrian statue of Richard Couer de Liontook a hanson and drove through Pimlico, through Victoria street and other streets of new andcomfortable houses, belonging very largely to the Marquis of Westministerthere over the scarcely finished Chelsea suspension bridge (had topayd 2d. toll each way) to Battersea Park - a park for the people andthey seemed to be enjoying it this fine afternoon. Some finetrees, and flower beds stiffly laid out; but tended with care and verypretty and tasteful altogeether very attractive, two or three houses of refreshment. Returningcame through Chelsea street where are Bassicks which must be a
fifth of a mile in length and some way up through Strand st toPiccadilly. From Battersea Park had noticed the Hospital, and a Cedar of Lebanon which Murray says is in Physic Gardens there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sept. 14&lt;/strong&gt; - Monday. Again to Westminster Abbey where wepoke about for a long time looking more particularly at theinteresting things that Mr. M. had shown us, at the Champslevé enamel which were were not accquainted with before.The Chapter House is very interesting. Near the entranceis the wooden door leading to where the Pyx was keptSome one who had tried to rob it was flayed and his skinnailed upon the door. Mr. M. remembered seeing somebit of it there, and put his hand over the top said he couldfeel some of it still. Lunched at the Criterion and came home.C. Went to bed with a headache. In the evening Mrs.L. Spencer and Charlie called also Mr. M., he broughtC’s watch and some photographs for us to look at.&lt;/p&gt;

The display was very beautiful. Lunch in South Kensington Museum. Noticed the ornamentsof pure gold brought from Ashantee, also slate swords etc etc. Noticedenamels which can be well studied here, think our little box”Tho absent not forgot” is Battersea Enamel - saw more champlieeenamel near by were the cloisonné a Limoges enamels. Upstairs in the jewel case is an enormous pearl 2 inches ormore long and about 1 in thick it is shaded, there are manyother interesting stones. Noticed the Henri II vase calledinlaid earthenware - very much valued. Found a courier waiting to see us when we returned.

They finished paering our street today.It seems to have been macadmised - they dug up the old stones andperhaps added some new, scattered fresh earth and watered it and rolledit down by means of a steam engine with the tires of each of the twowheeles about a foot wide and behind a roller of about thrice the widthwhich would have just fitted  xxxx them. The job is not very good.&lt;/p&gt;

sea-sick. I did not disgrace myself. There were four or five French fishermenand a little boy on board who has been run down at sea in their boat.He excited a good deal of sympathy particularly one man who was injured -the father of the boy. It was curious to see the women hauling the trunks -they looked old; but were very brisk. In short dark woollen dresses withwet worsted stockings and wooden shoes, carefully flushed white caps and long mas-sive looking gold earings. She looked very clean, and quite happy. We were sometime detained at the Douane.

J. says they are ousins, very good to eat and inthe proper season are four or five inches across. Left intrain about noon, and being behind time did not reach&lt;/p&gt;

Thursday A… and various kinds of palins alsoprickle pear, with fruit on it (which I recognize as what Ibought some years ago, look like little pine apples). Orange andlemon trees, all in the hotel garden before our windows and beyondthe sea, of which we hear the roll distinctly. Took a superbdrive, and the “grand tour de la Californie pas le caual”charming views, Esterel rocks jutting out proudly with thesea towards the west. In front Ile St. Margueritefrom which Marshal Bazaine recently escaped. Villa dottedall over the landscape. Vegetation charming quite differentfrom any thing to which I am accustomed. The fragrantyellow cassia in bloom from which they make scent. Theblue green eucalyptus tree a pleasing variety and many othernovelties. Returning stopped at Villa San Jean, belongingto the Comtesse de Chaponay, very beautiful did not gointo the house though the old servant who knew of Cath urged us to do so. Drove in the opposite direction to seewhere Lord Brougham had lived. Walked in the afternoon.Old town very narrow and dirty. Went into market just asthey were removing the booths. Peaches, chestnuts, pearsgrapes, tomatoes beans etc. There is a factory of pottery herefine shapes, coarse ware, attempts at Etruscan, cheap.Saw men driving piles. Twelve men pulled ropes tolift - a heavy arrangement of iron and stone and then let itfall upon the pile. Dreadful labor. Charming re….Two months away from home today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 23&lt;/strong&gt; Friday Left Cannes towards noon and should havebeen at Nice in an hour. Train about a half hour behindtime and there a long detention in leaving station at Nice.Hotel de France, considered best cuisine in Nice, ….rooms, lovely southern exposure. Walked about promenadesAnglais, bridges over the Piglione, looked in at the Chauvain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 24&lt;/strong&gt; Saturday No letters. C. took me up stairs at thechauvain and showed me the room occupied four years ago etc.Soon after noon went by rail three quarters of an hour toMonaco, in omnibus up the hill to the palace. Built arounda hollow square, the arcades of which have tawdry frescoes of century, some represent the labours of Hercules from whomMonaco is said to date. A fine marble st… going up both ways.The appartments tasteful, the floors marble f the ordinary peacheycolor coarse mosaics so much used in Italy, poor portrait offamily conections, some reigning in Austria, Bavaria et. Finebedroom where the Duke of York, brother to George the third died. Theview from the windows much interesting. The garden is ….-ing t….d on the slope of the hill, carefully laid out next thetropical vegetation to which we are becoming quite accustomed. A ten minute drive or less to Monte Carlo. We enteredthe casino, directly opposite the entrance a fince concertwas going on in a large hall. The audience only abouttwenty five patrons. Towards our right was a beautifulreading room in a rather Pompeian style of decoration - abundantly supplied with papers. Turning back to the leftcrossing a richly decorated room where no one was sitting toone still riches  in something of a Moorish style when werethe gambling tables - about sixty persons were sitting atthem playing of whom ten were women. There might havebeen thirty or more looking on. Outside are gardens beautifullylaid out and an excellent hotel, also a restuarant. Were back at Nice by 5.30. The shop keepers do not find enough visitors yet for them to open their shop. Many have the shutters still closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 25&lt;/strong&gt; - Sunday. Drove to C….s Arrived there the roadruns directly through the remains of a Roman amphitheatrecontinued to the church built on the site of a temple of DianaPeeked into the cloisters of Franciscan convent adjoining. Wentinto cemetery. For the centre was a fine monument to anEnglish lady. In front of the church are several magnificienttrees “chenes Virls” Several hundred years old. Returned byway of Carabacel( a part of Nice further removed from the sea)There seemed to be a great many villas, some of them veryfine.Drove the whole length of promenade anglais,very pretty, it took about 8 minutes. Saw G. Crosby andwife in front of his house there. Drove over bridge to the oldtown and got out and walked about some of the narrowstreets and market places. Stepped into a house that lookedfiner than the rest, it had belonged to a noble family butno to some one else and seemed used in part as ersatz tenementhouse. After lunch went to the English church buthad made a mistake in the hour of service. The churchis very pretty and neat stained glass windows, font nearthe door. The grave yard between the church and the street. In the afternoon went over to the park to hear the music, partlywith the hope of seeing M. Thiers who had just arrived. droveto the old chateau, charming view, Nice laying below, and thedry bed of the torrent distinctly dividing the old and new townsa amphitheatre of hills surrounding it except where the Mediterranean stretched. Many villas on the hill sides. In frontof our hotel, the date palm and Eucalyptus alternate. It is onlyabout ten years since the first Eycalyptus were planted hereand they are large trees. They seem to have leaves of twodistincally different shapes or perhaps they change in shapeas the tree grows older. It only grows between Marsailles and Genoa. The bark is smooth but peels offeven quite cut on the branches giving it a ragged appearance.The pepper trees here are very pretty with their fine foliage andbright peppers hanging down. Nor quite …. which began of Cannes still contains. Waiters and some of the visitors look as if in early shapes of small pox&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 26&lt;/strong&gt; Monday - Vetterino and four horses at 8 1/2 a.m. - crossedthe Pallion and directly the road began to ascend, fine viewsover Nice and and its hills, seemed to follow the Pallion which isbanked up for many miles and perfectly dry up here. theMediterranean and its coast seam spread as a map below us - counted fifty sails in sight at once. This coast is full ofcharming bays. Our departure by vetturino seemed to createsome excitement among the passers by at Nice. Before we were fairly out of the city our leaders turned right roundto look in the carriage window they had not been usedin this way before; but afterwards went well ; we keptthem about two hours. Up on our left we could see thesnowy points of the Col de Lende (of the Maritime Alps) andthe distant hills looked bleak, though those near wecould see were often terraced to the top and planted withthe vine, the fig and olive. We looked down of Ville F…with its beautiful bay where our squadron winteredfour years ago, then came the long projectiongpeninuslar of Ospizio with its lighthouse. Soon welooked down on the high isolated hill of Ese with its ruinof what must have been a fedual castle, and houses allabout on the ride towards the sea. A real robberstronghold. Had a grand view of Monaco, and MonteCarlo. Passed through the village of Roccabruna, builton (Murray says) Eocene breccia, great masses of which arestanding in among the houses. A very romantic place. Before coming to Roccabruna saw that deeply indented whiteleaf now so fashionable in N. Y. growing on the side of therock, all the same color. Saw jig trees as large as large appletrees and very fine old olive trees. Reached Murtana about12 1/2 P.M. Lunched at Hotel Victoria seemed a good hotel and thetown seemed quite flourishing. We left before two and sooncame to the French frontier where our veterino’s papers we examined and some formality (a pass or something given).Corssed Pont St. Louis which is the boundary between Franceand Italy and on top of the hill encountered the Italian customs housewho took Josephine’s word and only examined her handbag! At Ventimiglia (the first Italian town) we passed right through afort for some distance, indeed all about here had the appearance of being strongly fortified. The town itslef looked very romanticand curious as we looked back at it from the bridge. Going through it it was curious to look in the … shops and narrowstreets.  At Bordigliera the date palm is cultivated for the church, and we saw so many we felt quite satiated. Manyof them were tied up to keep their centres white for Palm Sunday. Some seemed to leaf out directly from the groundto grow quite wild. Some were only bare stalks the leaves having all been cut from the top. Arrived at San Remo Hotel Bellerice soon after 5 P.M. Charming situation, excellentclean hotel. While taking our dinner we enquired about the tabled’hote and found that the two gentlement dining at a neighboringround table, like our own, composed the whole table d’hote.One of them is a young English clergyman, perhaps the onesttled here. Three days ago we and one gentleman composed thetable d’hote at Nice. Today had shown us a successionof beautiful pictures and the weather has been perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 27&lt;/strong&gt; Tuesday - Not being aware of our change from Paris to Roman time we kept our vetterino waiting a long half hourdid not start until 9 a.m. A gentleman in the breakfast roomwho with his wife had just come from Rome and Naples sayshe did not find it at all too warm. On our way out of SanRemo passed a number of hotel evidently fitted up for theEnglish. Our road lay along the coast, on our right laya great expanse of sea with not enough land to make itpicturesque and on our right the hills had been out away fromthe road so that they were no longer beautiful, crossedthe railroad track repeatedly. At San Stefano saw agreat many nets drying and a vessel being repaired. At Porte Maurizio were many vessels drawn upon the sand. AtOriglia crossed a fine suspension bridge and stopped 2 hours at the innto rest the horses and lunch. Walked with Josephine, bought somegrapes and peaches and a little sacuer of polenta which we tasted in thestreet. There seemed to be no regular market place, but womeneverywhere selling fruit and veg. A great deal of Italian paste for sale.This morning saw a woman with a great square green cake on herhead for sale. It was dried green pease made into this form, a lot of puree.Part of the time were shut in by olive trees. After Capo delle Mole thevegetation looks more home like - the birch and horsechestnut appearand the cypress and agave have almost disappeared. Crossed once clearstream of running water, where there was no bridge nor embankment, forded the shallow stream. Very pretty views now manytowns on surrounding hills, reached Alassio about 4. P.M. Hotel de Londrespainted gayly outside, the back of it is upon the sandy beach whereis quite a good surf and great noise. From our terrace saw a steamer passing. C. andI took a walk, saw orange tree large and great apple trees and full of  fruit. Wnet up on a sort of paved donkey road on a terassedhill side, might have gone to the summit but it was toofatiguing. The man wanted to give us somee white arte…This seems to have been a walled town. From our terrace saw the moon rise beautifully over the hills and reflect on the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 28&lt;/strong&gt; Wednesday. The sun rose beautifully out of the water soonafter 6 1/2 A.m. We …. breakfast, made up for it by figs in the carriage.Started at 9. The whole road has been much more interesting thanyesterday. Especially the last half, blod rocks rising to a very greatheight, somethree times passed through tunnels, sometimes throughdeep cuttings in the rock, and sometimes was blasting out out …perpendicular side. A very fine piece of engineering it seemed.Saw many gray old towns among the hills, often as gray as therocks themsleves. In sight of our hotel was the bold island ofGallinaria with a ruined tower etc. Some time before 11 a.m.corssed a stream and on our right was the R.r. bridge and just beyond thatwas a bridg of a single very wide arch; the upper surface of itgoing up to a joint- it might have been of Roman origin. Passedthrough the narrow streets of several towns and stopped to rest atFinale Marina, Hotel National, formerly Palazzo Ruffini - a finestone stair case, and large high rooms. The dining room was hung withpictures belonging to the family of our host - one portrait of a gilr hesaid was by Van dyk. An american had bought some of his oldsaints. Walked aobut eh place, quite a handsome Duomo.They are very busy enriching it now. A man opened a custom
to show us a picture crucifixion of St Andrew by Carlo Muratto. We restedabout 1 1/2 hours, reached Savone at 4 P.M. Albergo Srvizzero close to the theatrewith illuminated dials, one showing days of the month. Not open this evening.After lunch passed Noli, still surrounded by walls and towers, or at leasta long bit of wall is seen. Not far off is Isola dei Borgazzi, onlythe seoncd island we have seen. Cliffs are wonderfully fine, watervery clear and of a beautiful color. Entering Savona passed amongperhaps a mile of brick yards, where most of the emplyees were women(yesterday saw a woman making mortar, and today women and girls carryinglarge stones on their heads, men and boys were carving the same, near where largequantities of stone were being quarried and shipped to Genoa. think I may haveseen in the distance the fortifications and light house belonging to Genoa.Took a walk in Savona, a large flourishing place. Cathedral seemd very handsome, large square columns supported the vaulted roofwere annoyed by a priest who wanted to show us the antiquities, whichhad been given by Julius 2 to an older cathedral here, he having been anative of the place. Walked through the market place, and up some marblesteps into the court of a large building occupied by government officescourts etc. One church was hung in black because they were sayingprayers for the release of some one’s soul. It seemed to me as if therailroad must have been half the time in tunnels today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oct. 29&lt;/strong&gt; Thursday - Left Savona soon after 9 A.M. C. madean effort and succeded in getting a piece of Eucalyptus.

Arrived at Cgoletto before noon, a dirty place, full ofbeggars, after a luncheon of fish, walk back to see the housewhere Columbus was born - a newly painted four storyhouse with inscriptions and wine shop below. A lfockof sheep came by as we were looking at it, and we sought refugein a vegetable shop opposite. The sheep helped themselves fromthe womans basket of beans. Many pretty views of hillsand villages; Genoa in sight. At Pegli we went to thePallavicini villa, were 1 1/2 hours. Were not shown the house as the familyare there. The grounds are really very interesting, cut outof the mountain side and made to look quite natural, someof the trees and shrubs brought from Savoy. We went in a boat in a stalactite cavern, among temples etc. Saw the ….of water; but were not wet. There were swings etc to amusechildren. Fine palms of different kinds, camphor tree etc.As we were about leaving the young marquis arrived with the architect. The young marquise was watching for him and came out to meet him. They had only been married twomonths. The rest of our journey was almost entirely between villas or in villages. It was twilight before we reached Genoa, in passingits fortifications had to pass through two gates. an officer cameto see if we had any thing in the carriage to declare. After passingthrough streets of what seemed magnificent palaces we arrive atGrand Hotel de Genes, 6. P.

Very enthusiasticabout the scenery which indeed was charming, only too manytunnels. He left at Spezia which seemed most exquisite, and madeus think that we ought to have arranged to stop there.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 14&lt;/strong&gt; Saturday. Neither of us went out, very rainey anddisagreeable. At 3.30 thermometer out of the window showed 41.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov 15&lt;/strong&gt; - Sunday Weather still raw. Did not go out until after lunch. Took the colli drive. Out of Port Romanoand along among pretty villas to San Miniato, lovelyviews all the way and especially from the front of SanMiniato, a burial place up here, the whole slabs are as closetogether as flagging - continued our course by the PiazzaleMichel Angelo, in the centre is a large bronze statueof David, fine views from this, returned into the city by PortaSand Niccolo, along by the Demidoff Palace and monumentby the Via dei Bardi and Ponte Vecchio and so Santa Crocewith its beautiful new facade and interesting monuments.and fine stained glass. The guide book must tell particulars.stopped a momement at Santa Maria Novella where the congretationwere assembling for vespers. All the altars were lighted, especiallythe high altar and hung with cloth of gold and silver and crimson, very beautiful it appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 16&lt;/strong&gt; Monday After stopping a few moments at San Lorenzonoticed the rich marble altar of colored marbles, the rich oblong puplitof bronze designed by Donatello, saw no way of getting into therealso the music gallery of light colored marbles, the tablet toBernardo Cennini who cast and printed from the first movabletype in Italy. To the Belle Arte where are particularlyfine examples of the earliest masters, gold ground inSaw some of their modern pictures, the Expulsion of theDuke of Athens by Etienne Usse was perhaps the finestsome of the pictures were quite poor. Some of the modernstatuary was fine. To the Uffizi and felt in dispairat being able to retain so little of what I have seen.Went rapidly through all the rooms that never open.The cabinet of gems is exquistetly fitted up and containslovely choice specimens in this department of art. Thereare two rooms full of …. of painters. Beautiful roomexpresly for Niobe and her children. Crossed through thelong gallery over the ponte vechio to the petite gallery. Thispassage way is 100 yds long and has many etchings and drawingsfrom the famous old masters and some fine tapestriesat the further end. All very interesting as are also the views from the windows. Went through the …..rooms as before and also some rooms adjoining whichare also interesting. The bronzes of Cain and Abel byDufies are fine (modern). Drove again aroundthe Cathedral - not far from the statues of Brunelleschi andArnolfo saw the “Sasso di Dante” where he used frequentlysite and meditate in the sun opposite the grand pile ofthe choir of the catheral. Passed in front of thehouse of Michel Angelo a wide house; but not very high plastered and painted of a light color. Some days ago passedthe house of Dante tall and very narrow, many of the windowswere out and it appeared to be entirely dilapitated Twowindows wide - that of M. A may be five wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 17&lt;/strong&gt; Tuesday Left Florence at 8.50 A.M. No carpetin car and no hot water - very cold - soon we put our waterproofs on over heavy cloaks and blanket shawl over knees.Italian gentleman pulled the cushion off the opposite seatfor our feet and took another for himself. This was a greatimprovement. Roses in bloom on the road side. Snow onthe Appenines. Every hill seemed to have its village.The cyress and umbrella Pines striking objects in the landscapes. A cloudy day. Sometimes the clouds almost entirely coveredthe country and then they rise and show it beautiful. The road layby Arezzo, Cortona with its long stretch of ancient wall to be seen from the R.R., Lake of Trasimene, Peuriga, which stretchesalong the hill side and seemed to me to have grown, Assisi , Foligno,Trer, then along the Clitumnus, a very narrow stream, Spoleto,Termi, where are the beautiful falls, Narni, where we sawthe noble ruin a Roman Bridge built by Augustus forThe Flaminian Way - one whole beautiful Arch stands, the piers oor two others. Soon after this it became too dark  Greg oxen, s…. at first were half … The wh… in middle, then all black.and later to see distinctly or with much pleasure. ReachedRome at 6.30 P.M. At Hotel de Russie found fireslighted and table spread which had an air of comfort. C.fears a headache from the great change of temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 18&lt;/strong&gt; - Wednesday. Not knowing whether we ought to be satisfied with our apartment having discovered anupturned sewer in the side street, we looked in severalhotels the only one inviting was the d’Italie overlooking thegardens of the Quirinal, thought a little of no 4 parler and twobedrooms 25 …. and up 92 steps au troisiem, there on second wereoccupied and au premeire we thought too near the garden. Camehome and changed to rooms au troisieme co. Babinio and Vicolo
….. all day. Looked at fountain Trevi and in Pantheon, pavement has beensomewhat changed. Outside very much worn away. Streettorn up there too. After lunch drove up Corso pastFountain of Trevi to Roman Forum workmen busy there,driver pointed out all objects of interest. Ascended capitolall the way up avove the bells to statue of St. HelenaDay wonderfully fine and clear, view superb, old manpointed out every thing, so that we understand relativepoistions better. Went into Colleseum, where they areexcavating ever so deep.Met Mr. Bernard Moritz overGerman of the R.R. Went into St Clements churchsomewhat curious, but there is an older one beneathInto St John Lateran, very large and fine, wonderfullyclean, beautiful marbles. Went into the neighboruingBaptistery erected by Constantine, all rich marbles.Looked up the Santa Scala, covered with wood. Andreturned home rather late. Met a great many privatecarriages in the Corso. At dinner an Englishman describedin a very interesting many a costume model that he…. they were drawing from last evening. He stoodtwo …. I saw plenty of picturesque costumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 19&lt;/strong&gt; - Thursday St. Peters, was shocked to find that a gooddeal of it is not real marble in fact was quite disappointedThe several chapels that were used by the Ecumenical couniclare still shut off, very much interfering with the fine effect.The names of those who were present on that occasion areengraved in tablets on the walls, often so ….ed as to be nearly unrecognisable. After lunch to the Palace of the Cesars where we took a guide, a French soldier who had been there all through the excavations and who showed us every thing with much interest and intelligence.Among the rest saw an Etruscan wall which the Romansthemselves had built over - saw the house of Livia the motherof Tiberius, frescoes wonderfully preserved, leaden pipes, with her name upon them. The house of Augustusa magnificent throne room, on one side of it a chapel and room for the Lares. one called a dining room,near it a boat like fountain. A tumble down stone wallis considered to be the original wall of Rome built by Romulus.For this and the other sites Mr. R… (a descdenant of Salvaotr Roza)has studied the ancients and gives reason for his faith. Remainsof the Palace of Caligula, house of Cicero, and I know not what besides.All this was extremely interesting. Guide gave me a beautifulAscanthus leaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 20&lt;/strong&gt; Friday. A rainy morning. To Palazzo Doria inthe Corso, very large and fine, built round to courts. Sawtwo sick looking Eucalyptus trees in the first. Hear that theminiter of Agriculture has ordered a quantity of them to beplanted all over Rome. And they are laying sewers everywhere. To the Capitol saw the beautiful Venus, Juliain her chair, the Faun in R…-Antico, the Dygin Gladiator,The Antinouss., a Faun, the heads of emperors, and many other interesting statues. Plinys Dove - a mosaic of the wall whichI do not remember. I have seen before and very different from any of the copies. The basin is repr…. as …the plumage of the Doves is rather stringy but they have anatural expression. After lunch to the Mesee of the Vaticanas we were only allowed two hours of course it was a hastyrun through its treasures. Glanced through the treasuresof the Braccio Nouvo, (the palace of many things statutes arechanged also in the Gall… of the Ariadne, saw the Apollo,the Laocoon, canvas Peresus (beautiful) and gladiators (all  thesecomparing favourably with the antique). The Antinous orMercury without either hand is a beautiful thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 21&lt;/strong&gt; Saturday. a beautiful day. Turned of the corso at the Piazzadi Venezia to the Piazza dil Gesu and into the church. the hall ofLapis Lazuli does not appear as large and wonderful as formerly. Wentto the Vicovaro Palace, but the Princess will not be there until the 1 Decopposite it is the Altieri Palace up the via di Ara Coeli and past the theatreof Marcellus which shows some beautiful old fleched corinthian columningnow all filled in and built upon, little shafts between them - a few stepsfarther came to a Fish Market and a sort of double Facade called the Porticoof Octavia. Driving along nearer the Tiber came to the beautiful littleTemple of Vesta now used as a church, near it is a fountain and opposite a churchSanta Maria in Cosmedin, was temple of Ceres and Porsephine, a curious oldplace. In the Portico is a huge round marble mask called “Boccadella Verita”. Out a the Porta San Paolo close to tombe of Caius Cestusof Protestant Burial Ground. Soon passed a little church on our leftsaid to mark where Peter and Paul rested in peace. A short drive to SanPaolo fuori Muri, very plain without but beautiful within. Ibelieve the handsomest church in Rome, rich in marbles whichare arranged with much taste. The walls are of bluish whitewith panels of some colored marble surrounded by a double borderof two different colors. Double aisles divided by grey granite columnsabove the columns all around a …. medallion heads of all the Popes. The rich Baldichino is suupported by four beautiful columns of Oriental Alabaster ….. by Pasha of Egypt. In eachtransept is altar of Malachite. Curious old mosaic over theHigh Altar and back in the choir. Mass was being celebrated ina chapel, lovely soft toned organ. A peep into the cleristyshowed curious old twisted columns. One beautiful old marblecandleabra stood in church. …. had a figure of satancowering underneath it while a boy supported it.Returened passed by Arch of Janus which was near Templeof Vesta, getting out of carriage walked under the arches ofCloaca Maxima. Woman were washing almost in it.Close to this was a small pretty white marble arch calledof Septimus Severus, a church is jammed against it.Passed house of Rienzi dilapidated, had columns withfine cornice and frieze built in it. Turn into the Ghetto; but itbeing the Jews Sabbath the shops were all closed. Afterlunch went to Vatican up the fine stairs to Raphael’sLoggia, which a dreadfully faded, very much since I sawthem, into the rooms continuing his frescoes, thoughin doing so passed through a room recently frescoedprobbly referring to the new dogma, they seemed fine. Raphaels Stanze seemed to me to have sufferred since I saw them.Into the rooms of painting - a lovely Murilla, madonna and child andSt. Catherine,  Domenichinia’s St. Jerome, Raphael’s Transfiguration,Madonna di Foligna, two lovely Persgnio’s, Santo Romualdoand some other saints in white by Andrea Sacchi very interesting.Hurried down to see the Sistine Chapel, but only to find that it closed a half hour earlier than the rest and so we were just toolate to see it. Consoled ourselves by going to the Pincian Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 22&lt;/strong&gt; - Sunday. The day being very fine decided to go overthe Appian Way instead of going to church. Stopped first atCaracalla’s Baths  a grand ruins. Much has beenexhumed lately by Mr. Rosa. In one large room aboutthe centre twelve hundred persons could bathe at once.Could see three diamond shaped holes where the watercame in and one largeer opposite to empty the waters out.This was the Frigidarium, lso saw the caldarium, and theTepidarium, the room for gladiatorial exercise, the privatebaths etc. Saw the earthen ware pipes for heating the roomsdifferent patterns of mosaic pavement, saw very rich andbits of mosaic that have fallen from the roof representingNeptune, fish etc - the floor of the same room being in a seated pattern. Some of the floors are quite cracked and waved fromand earthquake in the fifth century. The walls are several feetthick. The building is upon a uniform plan, one half of it beinglike the other. Then continuing on the Via appian wentinto the Catacombs of St. Callisto which we had expectedto find lighted in honor of this St Cecilia’s day; but the illumination is postponed until tomorrow and we each took a taper and groped our way along the narrow mouldy passagesnarrow shelfes about four or five often in the height ofeight or ten feet on each side, and were glad in about fiveminutes to have arrived at the other end of our journey.Continued to Cecilia Metalla’s tomb, walls aboutthirty five Roman ft thick. We went a little furtherand had a very beautiful view of the aqueducts far up tothis the walls of the vineyards on either side prevent usseeing any thing. Returning stopped to see a columbariumie house under ground about thirty feet deep and about twentysquare - full of little low, broad arched niches, each one containing twovases generally round and covered by a red earthen cover someseven or eight inches in diameter. In some case the nichewas higher and the vase stood fully exposed to view. There were several busts in one columbarium. An inscription above eachniche. I put my hand in a jar and lifted up some little pieces of charredbone. In one of these buildings was a column in the centre with niches andtwo large niches where statues might have stood. On one side of itwere painted doves etc. In the afternoon to St. D… but thebest music was over before we got there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 23&lt;/strong&gt; Monday - As the king was to go in state to open the house of parliament we tried to get a stand for our carriagein the Piazza Colonna but was not allowed and as it was too cold for us to stand in the street gave it up. Drove toCastellani’s to see his jewellry but he was on duty withthe king. Went to the Bankers, saw Mr. Hooker, saw whereMrs Spencer lived and looked at jewlry in that building and thenat some of Anderson’s photographs. After lunch went to seethe American church which is up to the top of the windowsred brick and white stone. Inside columns of granite with little white columns lit in and resting on rosso antico below whichis a bleuish marble. Santa Maria Maggiore, place where Pio IX is to be buried before the high altar, descending to the place by staris asbefore the balidchina at St Peters. To San Clemente which was decorated and illuminated in honor of the saint, went down to two subterranean temples one below the other, the lowest of all had been heathen and today water stood in it and dripped from the walls.The under church is plainly arched double aisles, frescoes quaint and curious, quite fresh, illuminated by candles whichdropped grease on the floors - walls etc nicely whitened.Many persons there, a curious sight. Above, the church washung in red and gold and had many worshippers. Stopped inthe coliseum they are excavating wonderfully, havegone down 25 or 30 ft. and some pavement of red and lightbrick. This will change all our long cherished memoriesof the arena indeed I do not see when there is to beany arena left. Called on Mrs. Beck in the corso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 24&lt;/strong&gt; Tuesday. A cloudy day started at 10 a.m. to goto the hunt not very far from tomb of Ceclia Metalla. Onlya few carriages. About 25 persons mounted to chase the poorfox - some wore scarlet coats one was a lady. Of hounds theremight have been 30 to fifty. They went off so quietly we hardlyknew when they started, they were soon far away overthe undulating ground and we could just see them with a glass.Then left before they returned. Stopped at the Coliseum andwent to the very topmost platform of this tremendous ruin. and looked into the far depths of the present excavations. Walked allaround among the arches and after coming down to what used to beconsidered the arena we went boldly down an inclined plain inamong the recently found arches etc into two or three long passagesheading ever so far away, saw the bronze sockets in the largeflag stones in the middle of the passage where the gates aresupposed to have turned to admit the animals. Some columnsand capitols and fragments of statuary and slabs with figures engrave on them.some of them representing fighting or chase. After a late lunch tooka walk through via Babuino, Condotie and Corso home. On the oldpavement below the arena are long pieces of charred woodwith smaller crossbars of the same - very curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 25&lt;/strong&gt; - Wednesday - Took a walk with J. looking in theshop windows bought small cards for Patience, and reutrned by wayof the steps of Piazza d’Espagna and Monte Pincio. After lunch droveto the Mausoleum of Augustus which is now a modern theatre and toPiazza Navona and to see the statue of Pasquin, time, and wind and weatherhave worn the features very much off the face, went into the courtof the Farnese Palace of which the splendid travertine was stolenfrom the coliseum and theatre of Marcellus and carefully laid together hereit is a noble looking building. Drove through the ghetto where abundance of old clothes were hanging out for sale to the RomanForum but were not permitted to descend without a permitcould see extremely well from above. Walked under the arches of the temple of Peace. The stucco mouldingabove still shows the pattern distinctly in many places.Yesterday saw yellow placards pushed up announcing the timeand place and route of the funeral of F…. the artist and invitinghis friends to come to it. His remains were carried by hisfriends and before it was carried his last unfinsihed work andhis palette and brushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 26&lt;/strong&gt; Thursday. Wrote for a d…. and tooka walk this afternoon stopped in Santa Maria del Popolorich in marbles and monuments. Saw a slab in the floor toPietro Girometti the celebrated cameo cutter who died in 1859aged 46, on the wall near the troughs is a bas relief of a headand inscription one Giuseppe Ginometti a great numismatistwho died in 1857 aged 71 and who we supposed to be the father of Pietro.Met Mr. and Mrs. Chichester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 27&lt;/strong&gt; Friday Left Rome at 9.50 AM. White frost onthe grass. It is said that ten persons were frozen to death lastnight in the  neighborhood of Rome. The road was very interesting for some time in sight of the aqueducts and among ruins.Picturesque towns on the hills - Shepherds with their sheep. People gatheringolives. Pretty costumes. Afternoon very cloudy reached Naples about5 P.M. Hotel Etas Unies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 28&lt;/strong&gt;. Saturday - not feeling satisfied with the situation of ourhotel we went in search and finally settled at Hetel de la Ville at thefurther end of the Chiara. A genuine rainy day. Next my trunkwas brought to my room last evening it was found to have beenunlocked and my … breast pin is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 29&lt;/strong&gt;. Sunday - English church - the best and simplest serviceI have attended since leaving home. Went for a half hour to themuesum and looked at frescoes and mosaics from Herculaneum andPompeii (the so called Prahael’s Hemes were there, in color .. blackground). Drove along the Corso Victor Emanuel and down through the Mugellina and Pozilno road. Driver took us past the Grottewithout showing it. A very beautiful view and fine sun set.A wonderful number of persons dirivng. A very gay sceneladies in light silks driving up and down and … to their friends.It seems as if I never saw anything like it. Talked to mynieghbor at dinner who had been to Pompeii today and is freshfrom Egypt where he found it very warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nov. 30&lt;/strong&gt; Monday - A rainy day, so passed it at the Museum after having risen early in the hope of going to Pompeii. The frescoes and fine mosaics from Pompeii are most interesting as also are the bronzes. Some of them are exquisite - the two Discoboli(from one of these the idea of the modern statue of Nydia seems to have been taken) the Mercury resting and the sleeping Faun (though this last seems to require some thing to rest against) the busts of Plato, Seneca and others. Many of the bronze statues have eyes made to represent life that is the white, pupil etc. Fine bronze statuettes. Some very beautiful sarcophagi in marble and fine reliefs. Looked at the rings intalgios etc, also thefine collection of Greek vases. The Etruscan vases are black figures on red ground while the Greek vases with which we are more familiar have red figures on black ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;december-1874&quot;&gt;December 1874&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dec. 1&lt;/strong&gt; - Tuesday - There when we hear bells tinkling and look out we either a cow with her calf going byaccompanied by some one carying a tin measure or else a number of goats passing for the same purpose. Theother day met a woman going through the street with a child’s coffin on her head. Looked in the shops for tortoiseshells and drove through the Strada del Porto, where are poor people and a market held every day in the street - the green vegetables looked very nice. In train of 12.20 to Pompeii. The guide first took into the museum where are the casts enclosing skeletons of several dead bodies look like statues when first rough hewn from the block, charred loaves of bread, various cooking utensils etc, then to the Basilica, Temple of Venus, Forum, to the two Theatres. At the house of the Baker saw the ovens, the grind stones large jar for water. Skeleton lef in one of the locales as it was found. In the Baths, the rooms are well preserved and all the arrangments can be understood, can be seen the lead pipes for bringing in the water and the places where it can be turned off, earthen pipes for carrying away the waste water. Pretty bas reliefs in stucco on walls and ceiling and often a little above the capital ofthe columns richly colored in red and blue. Where they are now excavating saw large fresco of Orpheus charming the wild beasts,and beyond it a room with bright orange colored walls, they are still excavating among the columns of the garden, we went above and saw the men working with their picks and shovels and the boys carrying the ashes and ground away in baskets on their shoulders. This gave us a view over the place. Came to the House of the Faun - in the mosaic in front of the door are the letters HAVE. It is avery large house occupying a whole block. It has two large gardens, one behind the other, in the first was found the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script can be found on Kris’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kshaffer/pypothesis&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. Here, I’m taking his output and banging it into my open notebook templates. I’ll need to fix some layout stuff I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;all editions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6600 files were downloaded; 333 files appear to be these missing editions with the placeholder text. I have not yet manually verified all of this… which is partly the point, right? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/stream?=user:shawn.graham&quot;&gt;shawn.graham&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;each text file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6267 print editions, from 1893 - 2010 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/stream?=user:shawn.graham&quot;&gt;shawn.graham&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;.75 range&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that is, from .72 to .9. They all have the same placeholder text, but the quality of the ocr makes some consistent errors, which is interesting. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hypothes.is/stream?=user:shawn.graham&quot;&gt;shawn.graham&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;misspelled-words-as-indicator&quot;&gt;Misspelled words as indicator&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://smgprojects.github.io/experiment-bad-equity/&quot; title=&quot;Experiment - Bad Equity&quot;&gt;Bad Equity&lt;/a&gt;’, I ran an experiment trying to sonify the dirtiness of the OCR. It was suggested to me by Ben Brumfield (in DH Slack) that perhaps something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://aspell.net/&quot;&gt;Aspell&lt;/a&gt; might be a useful avenue to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following script runs each text file in turn through Aspell’s spell checker. The basic idea is to compare the number of ‘mispelled’ words (per Aspell’s English Canadian dictionary) to the total number of words in each document. Thus, the closer that ratio gets to 1, the worse the OCR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-script&quot;&gt;The script&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;for f in *.txt; do
  totalbadwords=&quot;$(cat &quot;$f&quot; | aspell list -d en_CA --encoding utf-8 | wc -w)&quot;
  totalwords=&quot;$(wc -w &quot;$f&quot;)&quot;
  echo &quot;$totalbadwords, $totalwords&quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; &quot;finalscore.csv&quot;
done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(also on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/shawngraham/239edbcd7f5a495a7218bb93a9ce76a1&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script iterates through each text file. &lt;code&gt;totalbadwords&lt;/code&gt; is a variable for storing the result of each file being run through Aspell’s dictionary, identifying ‘mistakes’, and then &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt; is used to count the number of these. &lt;code&gt;totalwords&lt;/code&gt; just counts the number of words in each file. These values are echoed to a csv file so that I can open it in a spreadsheet or wherever to count, graph the result. Yes, I could do that in the script too I expect, but trying to write scripts that do one thing and one thing only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;output&quot;&gt;output&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the output is sitting on my laptop, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AfowhLwZQuuYMZtTDrD0riW33UPPxlgjwSumAJBrU2M/edit#gid=1997085128&quot;&gt;here on gdocs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;graphs&quot;&gt;graphs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tweeted some of the resulting graphs. In reverse order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;source-materials&quot;&gt;Source Materials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shawville &lt;a href=&quot;http://theequity.ca/&quot;&gt;Equity&lt;/a&gt; is a weekly newspaper published in Shawville Quebec. It has published continuously since 1883, when it was first published in the county seat, Bryson. Recently, the Provincial Archives of Quebec (‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.banq.qc.ca/&quot;&gt;Bibliotheque et Archives Nationales du Quebec&lt;/a&gt;’) scanned and OCR’d the &lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/&quot;&gt;run from 1883 to 2010&lt;/a&gt;, using the materials held at the Equity’s office, as part of a larger project to scan the journals of Quebec’s long-established English communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially thought I would have to download all of the pdfs and extract the text layer from those, but in the repo, both the pdf and the txt file are available as separate files. I’ve re-posted an example &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/shawngraham/8323899898cf016d5829f68394e63699&quot;&gt;text file here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered: how good is the OCR? And, without manually checking each text file, can I auto-magically generate some sort of proxy for assessing this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-obtaining-the-text-files&quot;&gt;Step 1. Obtaining the text files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obtaining the text files was just a matter of correctly formatting a &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; command. For whatever reason, I had a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of trouble doing this. All I really needed to do was point wget at this directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/&quot;&gt;http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/ -A .txt -r --no-parent -nd –w 2 --limit-rate=10k&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but, for whatever reason, I felt I needed to generate a list of urls first, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; point wget at it. My &lt;code&gt;urlgenerator.py&lt;/code&gt; was derived from the Programming Historian lesson on &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/applied-archival-downloading-with-wget&quot;&gt;applied archival downloading&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;urls = &#39;&#39;;
f=open(&#39;urls.txt&#39;,&#39;w&#39;)
for x in range(1883, 2011):
    urls = &#39;http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/%d/\n&#39; % (x)
    f.write(urls)
f.close
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben also suggested a way of doing this in Ruby, to get right down to the month &amp;amp; day subdirectories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Ruby&quot;&gt;t=Time.new(1883,05,01)
400.times { print&quot;http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/#{t.year}/#{t.month}/#{t.day}/83471_#{t.year}-#{t.month}-#{t.day}.pdf\n&quot;; t += 6*24*60*60 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…although because the archives uses leading zeros for months 1 - 9 and days 1 - 9, some more fiddling is required. In the end, if I could’ve just sussed wget properly in the first place… ah well. Learning Ruby is clearly something I need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I downloaded every edition from 1883 through to the end of 1914, 1595 files. This took the better part of a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-has-anyone-else-tried-to-do-this&quot;&gt;Step 2. Has anyone else tried to do this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the answer is, yes, yes they have. A quick question on Twitter brought me to this post by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ryanfb.github.io/etc/2015/03/16/automatic_evaluation_of_ocr_quality.html&quot;&gt;Ryan Baumann, Assessing OCR Quality&lt;/a&gt;. Later, I also had an excellent discussion with Ben Brumfield who pointed me to his work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.ca/2013/02/detecting-handwriting-in-ocr-text.html&quot;&gt;detecting handwriting in OCR’d texts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/idigbio-aocr/HandwritingDetection/blob/master/code/find_labels_with_handwriting.rb&quot;&gt;code for the same&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t tried Ben’s script yet. Below, I discuss trying to get Ryan’s approach to work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-ryans-scripts&quot;&gt;Step 3. Ryan’s scripts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan’s scripts work by automatically detecting the language of each line in the ocr’d text. It uses a python module called &lt;code&gt;[langid](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py)&lt;/code&gt; to determine the probability that a text is in a particular language. Badly OCR’d lines make determining this difficult. His two scripts (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/ryanfb/0ee1082a597e200ca8c3#file-scorelines-sh&quot;&gt;scorelines.sh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/ryanfb/c9bd9a1ce0f6f7cb2a45#file-ocrquality-rb&quot;&gt;ocrquality.rb&lt;/a&gt;) eventually should result in a value between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates no problem in assessing the language, hence, good OCR. (See Ryan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ryanfb/status/730085822817566721&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;first hiccup: &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt;. Forgot I had to &lt;code&gt;sudo chmod 700 scorelines.sh&lt;/code&gt; etc so that they’d work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;second hiccup: depending on the txt file, the scripts would work, or crash spectacularly with a wide variety of errors. Because of that variety, my suspicion is that special characters in the text file - or possibly (probably?) weird encoding - is causing the scripts to break. A long trawl of stackexchange had me try &lt;code&gt;LANG=C&lt;/code&gt; pre-pended, eg,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ LANG=C ./scorelines.sh filename.txt | ./ocrquality.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and again, sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t. If I ran &lt;code&gt;scorelines.sh&lt;/code&gt; on its own, piping the output to file, which I then fed into &lt;code&gt;ocrquality.rb&lt;/code&gt;, sometimes that would work when the two commands piped together wouldn’t. And sometimes not. The only common denominator was the txt file itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In which case, could the count of special characters be taken as a proxy for bad OCR?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it’s at this point that I should return to Ben’s script, which parses each file with regex to count the myriad ways OCR can break, and creates a kind of tabular record of the same. For his purposes - identifying handwriting in printed text - this gives him an indication of which files to peruse more carefully. In a twitter exchange, we talked about ‘why special characters?’. I showed him the sample txt (linked above) and he noted that I had way more special characters than him. This got me to thinking: what about Ryan Cordell’s post on ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://ryancordell.org/research/qijtb-the-raven/&quot;&gt;Qijtb the Raven&lt;/a&gt;?’. He uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/&quot;&gt;exiftool&lt;/a&gt; to see the metadata in the pdfs, which gives him crucial information on how the pdfs were generated. &lt;strong&gt;I need to do this too&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At any rate, at this point, I wondered two things: 1) how carefully did they set up their OCR? and 2) is this related to the (likely?) possibility that the person running the OCR application does not speak English as a first language? Is there a quality control issue at play during the process of scanning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-counting-special-characters&quot;&gt;Step 4. Counting Special characters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a script to count special characters was actually hard to find. I tried &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt; at first, to see if that could give me any useful output:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;find . -name &#39;*.txt&#39; | xargs wc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…which, when piped to file, would give me the number of lines, number of words, and number of bytes. This output did not seem meaningful.
- more perusal of stackexchange found this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;for f in *.txt; do
python -c &quot;import collections, pprint; pprint.pprint(dict(collections.Counter(open(&#39;$f&#39;, &#39;r&#39;).read())))&quot;
done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this gave me the count for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; character. This was a bit more useful, in that there is a fixed universe of possible characters, right? So I could maybe look at the ratio of the alphabet characters a-z to all the special characters. Since English doesn’t use diacritical marks (but this being a paper in Quebec, there will be a certain amount of French marks), special characters, plus umlauts, etc, could be useful. &lt;strong&gt;I have not yet calculated a ratio score&lt;/strong&gt;. I only just thought of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on DH Slack, I described what I was up to in the ‘DHAnswers’ channel. Finlay McCourt re-wrote the script:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python
import collections, pprint, re, sys
with open(sys.argv[1],&#39;r&#39;) as file_in:
    chars = re.sub(&#39;[\s\w!!&quot;#$%&amp;amp;()*+,-./:;&amp;lt;=&amp;gt;?@^_`{|}~\[\]\&#39;\\\]&#39;,&#39;&#39;, file_in.read())
    counts = collections.Counter(chars)
pprint.pprint(counts.most_common())
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…which counts the special characters, and puts them into a json-ish format. I called this script &lt;code&gt;bettercount.py&lt;/code&gt; and put a bash wrapper around it: &lt;code&gt;for f in *; do python bettercount.py $f; done&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, in my directory with the txt files, I piped commands together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;./feedfile.sh &amp;gt; output.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…which passes each file to bettercount.py. I opened &lt;code&gt;output.csv&lt;/code&gt; in Sublime Text (which handles find &amp;amp; replace much better than Atom). I delete new lines to get each file and the number and count of special characters, one per line. I know I could have done this in my &lt;code&gt;bettercount.py&lt;/code&gt; script, but &lt;em&gt;shrug&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m working on a Mac, and I’ll be damned if I can figure out Numbers for working with spreadsheets. I copied my output to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g04mSEYUA11uGnW6QDOyOXOcrYh6DRlLOIvytXHTXd8/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;google spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;. I added up the number of special characters. &lt;strong&gt;Again, I could calculate a ratio here of numbers of special characters to possible special character types, to normalize things&lt;/strong&gt;. That might be a good idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-visualizing-the-results-how-bad-is-my-ocr&quot;&gt;Step 5: ‘Visualizing’ the results: How bad is my OCR?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m not keen on graphs at the moment. As part of a larger project, I’m trying to make visualization strange again so that the kinds of unconsicous bias that come from received notions of how-to-graph-things don’t get in the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So I sonified all this with Musicalgorithms.com, &lt;a href=&quot;http://musicalgorithms.org/3.0/index.html&quot;&gt;version 3&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;take the column of numbers to sonify. Remove line breaks so that all the numbers are on a single line, separated by a single space&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;paste this line into the musicalgorithms csv format:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csv&quot;&gt;# Of Voices, Text Area Name, Text Area Data
1,morphBox,
,areaPitch1,1140 2 991 [etc]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hit the ‘load’ button on Musicalgorithms, &lt;strong&gt;paste&lt;/strong&gt; the formatted data into the box. (I say ‘paste’ because loading the csv directly, when you have this many ‘notes’, seems to introduce errors that bork the sonification).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I moved directly to ‘play/download’ and accepted all of the default parameter mappings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I placed the resulting .mid file into Garageband to try to make the ‘sonification’ into rather more pleasing music. Well, ‘pleasing’ for a given value of pleasure, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the ‘music’ can be heard at &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/shawn-graham-60451318/bad-equity&quot;&gt;soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the defaults at musicalgorithms take the first few notes and apply a kind of &lt;em&gt;ritardo&lt;/em&gt; to slow them down, to make a kind of intro.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I added the drum beat because part of my larger project is to acknowledge the performative, &lt;em&gt;capta&lt;/em&gt; aspect of all visualization. It’s jarring, and that’s deliberate, because I want the listener to reflect on the performative aspects of all visualizations… that’s a post/paper for another day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can hear the deep plunks when there are gaps in the record; you can hear the really high notes when a txt file is filled with garbage. The rather narrow range of notes implies that there are certain kinds of special characters that repeat over and over, which is suggestive of the kinds of errors that the OCR is making.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Garageband makes a kind of visualization of the music, a player-piano roll-esque side-scroller, showing the values mapped over the 88 tones of the keyboard. This visualization, notwithstanding what I said above, is actually rather interesting:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CiI9f_oWsAEzwoN.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;garagebandviz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note how the notes are rather dispersed in the earliest scans (at left, 1883) and become more and more tightly focussed as time spans towards 1914 (at right). That up-and-down tick at the right? My suspicion, yet to be confirmed, is that that corresponds to either a) new printing technology b) new typeface c) the move to Shawville when Shawville began to eclipse Bryson for prominence d) all of the above?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-have-i-learned&quot;&gt;What have I learned?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dipping into the txt files from 1914, the eye can immediately determine that we have better quality scans. Using the special characters as a proxy for bad OCR &lt;strong&gt;seems&lt;/strong&gt; to be valid. But how can I validate this impression?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the patterning of the cloud of special characters &lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt; be giving me a way of exploring something of the materiality of printing? It reminds me of Ingrid’s DH MA thesis at Carleton, where she adduced how small errors in reprints of &lt;em&gt;A History of the Pyrates&lt;/em&gt; said more about the culture/physical situation of printers than the world of authors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For all my sonification, it’s the visual player-piano roll that seems to be giving me the most useful information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That said, the sound itself forces a different kind of attention whilst listening, and the narrowing of tone over time does come across. Or am I just looking for that, now that I’ve seen the player-piano roll? Another ‘auditory hallucination’? see my &lt;a href=&quot;http://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/sonification&quot;&gt;Programming Historian tutorial (under-review version)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What’s going on here? If that song was already known to you, you probably heard the actual ‘words’. Yet, no words are present in the song - if the song was not already familiar to you, it sounded like garbled nonsense (see more examples on Andy Baio’s website). This effect is sometimes called an ‘auditory hallucination’. This example shows how in any representation of data we can hear/see what is not, strictly speaking, there. We fill the holes with our own expectations. &lt;br /&gt; Consider the implications for history. If we sonify our data, and begin to hear patterns in the sound, or odd outliers, our cultural expectations about how music works (our memories of similar snippets of music, heard in particular contexts) are going to colour our interpretation. This I would argue is true about all representations of the past, but sonifying is just odd enough to our regular methods that this self-awareness will help us identify or communicate the critical patterns in the (data of the) past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-do-next&quot;&gt;To do next:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;get more txt files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;re-run the analysis. Do the patterns hold up?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;try calculating ratios&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;try Ben’s script&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what are the special characters doing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use exiftool to consider the metadata&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how can I make this data haptic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
