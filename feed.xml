&lt;p&gt;John sat down with Andrew Byrd and Brenna Reinhart Byrd, linguistics experts invited by Ubisoft to create two languages for use in Far Cry Primal. The conversation ranged from discussing Andrew and Brenna’s involvement in the development process to the challenges and rewards of seeking an “authentic” approach to recreating historical (and prehistoric) events in works of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nb - I turned the html version of this paper into a pdf so I could read and annotate it in Skim, wherein I have a script to export all my annotations as the markdown you see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-reading-steinian-texts-with-music-and-with-computers&quot;&gt;Background: reading Steinian texts with music and with computers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘use musical composition and computational tools to help express something inherent to Stein’s texts that was otherwise obscured with more traditional readings’ &amp;lt;-  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#5&quot;&gt;Page 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘readers argue that setting a Steinian text to music is a welcome abstraction that brings the text to new heights of expression, while computing them seems to concretise their subtleties and diminish their expressive possibilities.’ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#5&quot;&gt;Page 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘In each of these cases, music brings out latent meanings in an otherwise inexpressive or unreadable text.’ &amp;lt;- the texts, as texts, are too dense, too troublesome; music makes the meaning &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#6&quot;&gt;Page 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘This attempt to engage with the meaning of the text by setting it to music is similar to attempts to read Stein texts with computational analysis.’ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#6&quot;&gt;Page 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘In either case, Bucknell and Goldsmith see musical and computational interventions as key to reading and understanding the texts’ ongoing processes of meaning-making.’ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#6&quot;&gt;Page 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Dusman’s narration of her entire process of setting Stein’s text to music is illuminating in terms of understanding how the process of musical annotation and computation share similar underlying methods for scaffolding (setting concrete and abstract textual elements to an external system) in order to express a reading of the text.’ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#7&quot;&gt;Page 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Systematically concretising the text was just one phase in the interpretive process: musical and computational transpositions create another level of abstraction with which the interpreter engages.’ &amp;lt;- this process is really interesting, especially when we think of things that are already abstractions, eg, topic models, word vectors, frequencies? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#7&quot;&gt;Page 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-computational-and-musical-renditions-tell-us-about-the-nature-of-representing-literary-texts&quot;&gt;What computational and musical renditions tell us about the nature of representing literary texts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Using digital and musical interventions to interpret texts means both concretising and abstracting as part of the interpretive experience.’ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#8&quot;&gt;Page 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, it is at the moment at which the text—whether it has been rendered in paragraphs on the typographical or manuscript page or in musical staffs or as data in bar graphs—is “played” that the reader or listener enters that space of interpretive activity. &amp;lt;- &lt;a href=&quot;#todo:&quot;&gt;how does the listener respond to my sonifications?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#8&quot;&gt;Page 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘A sense of “playing” a visualisation is important to note in the context of this discussion because, in the digital humanities, we still tend to “read” a visualisation on a computer screen, whether in tables, in heat maps, or in elaborate and networked spidery nodes.’ &amp;lt; - so let’s get beyond the screen essentialism &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#8&quot;&gt;Page 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘One “reads” a visualisation, but to “play” the visualisation is to engage the spatialised interpretation of that visualisation as an embodied reader in a situated context within a specific hermeneutical framework.’ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#9&quot;&gt;Page 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘First, in seeming contrast to the move from musical score to performance—from two-dimensional representation to four-dimensional life in which we understand that there are multiple levels of interpretation such as the composer’s, the producers’, the performers’ and the distant listener’s—computing seems to distill the many-layered four-dimensional space of the text in perfor- mance (i.e., embodied within the performance network of interpretations with the listener in time and space) into a two-dimensional script called “code.” In other words, historically, the musical score is understood as an attempt to represent complex relationships such as the co-occurrence of multiple elements across time and space, a representation that is a provocation to further interpretation.’ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#9&quot;&gt;Page 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she cites drucker’s notion of &lt;a href=&quot;#todo:&quot;&gt;observer-codepence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#9&quot;&gt;Page 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;audacity&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Likewise, instead of reading a two-dimensional visualisation as the inevitable result (or complete representation) of data analysis, we learn to read visualisations as musical scores, as signposts pointing towards many possible interpretive “results” or readings’ &amp;lt;- the next step clearly to make them &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; scores…? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#10&quot;&gt;Page 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘That is, the reader reads the musical score with the necessary perspective of capta rather than data because she expects the musical graphical representation to be, not only based on interpretation but also open to interpretation and meant to be played, to be spatialised in time and embodied by voices. Likewise, mindful of the situated hermeneutical framework that we bring to our readings of all data visualisations, we can learn to create and read computational visualisations as capta.’  &amp;lt;- and so, if we move beyond visualization and attend to the other senses, the emphasis on ‘data’ naturally would shift to ‘capta’ more fully? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#10&quot;&gt;Page 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; discussing using audacity’s native visualization tools to understand sound-as-visualization - “Unlike a waveform, a spectrogram shows the information necessary to plot prosody features that include timbre and accent, features to which Bernstein and others have attributed meaning-making properties.” &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#13&quot;&gt;Page 13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prosevis&quot;&gt;ProseVis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://tclement.ischool.utexas.edu/ProseVis. &amp;lt;- tool to visualize the ‘pre-speech potential of sound’  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#14&quot;&gt;Page 14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it visualises the XML transcription that OpenMary produces in the process of creating an audio file. &amp;lt;- makes me think of Rob’s raspberry pi device for sonifying the data lost in OCR… &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#15&quot;&gt;Page 15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘the ProseVis interface encourages interpretive activity in which the reader engages in a performance of all of these elements, enacted within the same kind of multilayered context of “observer-codependence” that an entourage of composers, producers, performers, and audience members would bring to a real time performance.’ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#17&quot;&gt;Page 17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-reading-steins-texts-with-digital-tools-can-tell-us-about-digital-humanities-scholarship&quot;&gt;What reading Stein’s texts with digital tools can tell us about digital humanities scholarship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘The traditions reflected in a computational visualisation are always part of a hermeneutic framework that is also always part of a history of technological and methodological remediations.’ &amp;lt;- see also tara copplestone on photobashing &amp;amp; remediation in archaeology &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://clement2013distant#18&quot;&gt;Page 18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘As a culture, we use sound to make meaning, but we have sublimated its study because, like studying “noise,” studying sound is inconvenient, logistically burdensome in terms of the richness of the resulting patterns, and requires a daunting degree of agency from the interpreter, who must establish new methodologies for interpretation.’ &amp;lt;- yeppers. &lt;br /&gt;

        <title>Kanban Style Board in Atom &amp;amp; this Notebook</title>
        <description>&lt;ul id=&quot;markdown-toc&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#kanban-board&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-kanban-board&quot;&gt;Kanban Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kanban-board&quot;&gt;Kanban Board&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanban boards are all over the place. At their simplest, it’s just a whiteboard with three colums, ‘to do’, ‘doing’, and ‘done’. You write your tasks on post-it notes, and move them through the columns as you do ‘em. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure who’s behind it, but ‘imdone’ has a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/packages/imdone-atom&quot;&gt;atom plugin&lt;/a&gt; that monitors your project for key phrases like TO DO in your code or your notes. Then, with alt+t, it opens up a board &lt;em&gt;inside atom&lt;/em&gt; where you can see all of your tasks - and move them around as you get through them. It’s pretty cool and works extremely well. Only hiccup I’ve encountered so far is making sure that the &lt;code&gt;.imdone&lt;/code&gt; config file is in my project folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now when I’m writing a note, I can turn any text I want into a &lt;code&gt;to do&lt;/code&gt; by making it into a special link, &lt;code&gt;[like this](#todo:)&lt;/code&gt;. The combination of imdone with mdwriter’s quick &lt;a href=&quot;http://smgprojects.github.io/getting-mdwriter-links-to-work/&quot; title=&quot;getting mdwriter links to work&quot;&gt;linking to my other notes&lt;/a&gt; make atom a great environment for writing this open notebook. The plugin has some other bits and bobs of functionality (like github issue tracking too!) so a great plugin for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>archaeogaming map</title>
        <description>
&lt;p&gt;A while back Andrew Reinhard devised a map of questions / relationships that could be usefully filed under the ‘archaeogaming’ rubric. I think it’d be handy to have a copy of that map filed here. The writeup of how I made it is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://electricarchaeology.ca/2015/12/18/a-map-of-archaeogaming/&quot;&gt;the blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>getting mdwriter links to work</title>
        <description>
&lt;p&gt;A useful add-on for Atom is &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/packages/markdown-writer&quot;&gt;md-writer&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, it allows me to make internal links to other notes in my notebook by highlighting a term, then hitting &lt;code&gt;command+shift+k&lt;/code&gt;. (This brings up a menu to allow me to select the relevant note. Say I wanted to cross-link to the code I used to sonify &lt;a href=&quot;http://smgprojects.github.io/sonification-of-john-adams/&quot; title=&quot;sonification of john adams&quot;&gt;the topic model&lt;/a&gt; of John Adams’ diaries, I’d highlight the term, hit the keystrokes, and there we go. Seems a little thing, but it’s very important for turning this whole thing into a wiki-style notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve installed the package, you need to set up a &lt;code&gt;.cson&lt;/code&gt; file for markdown that tells it where to find the posts. For reference sake, it should look something &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zhuochun/zhuochun.github.io/blob/cb34e3c16d42c52b281c34920ad55bbca223ac23/_mdwriter.cson&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. The important bits there are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;siteUrl: &quot;http://smgrojects.github.io/&quot;
# URLs to tags/posts/categories JSON file
urlForTags: &quot;http://smgrojects.github.io/tags.json&quot;
urlForPosts: &quot;http://smgrojects.github.io/posts.json&quot;
urlForCategories: &quot;http://smgrojects.github.io/categories.json&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those .json files are generated from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/zhuochun/fe127356bcf8c07ae1fb&quot;&gt;this code&lt;/a&gt;; they live inside my &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; folder and are generated when I &lt;code&gt;jekyll build&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#initial-thoughts&quot; id=&quot;markdown-toc-initial-thoughts&quot;&gt;initial thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;main-conceit&quot;&gt;main conceit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android &amp;amp; IOS. Game website is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.evolvingplanetgame.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.evolvingplanetgame.com/&lt;/a&gt;. Main blurb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s the year 3016, and you are in charge of an archaeological expedition to the planet Kepler-1138. Your aim is to know what happened to the Lovans, humanoid aliens that became extinct for unknown reasons. &lt;br /&gt; You will use artificial life to replicate the story of the mysterious species. Will you develop their technology, make them experts on warfare or strengthen their cultural influence? Choose carefully your strategy to reveal the past of the Lovans, and also their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So an agent based model. Game play revolve around tweaking settings in order to guide the bots across the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;framed explicitly as ‘xenoarchaeology’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;evolution of the robots artificial society then is examined for clues on the ‘actual’ society of Lovans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tutorial-levels&quot;&gt;tutorial levels&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;framing discussion for each level mimics evolution of hominins on earth - dispersal, colonisation of new ecological niches, ect.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;eg Level 5:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our bots will need to interact with other groups during the archaeological expedition. &lt;br /&gt; The planet was not populated only by Lovans, just like the Earth was not a Homo sapiens-only club. We shared Eurasia with Neanderthals for 5,000 years. They were also hominis quite similar to us in many respects, including the use of technology, culture and even language. &lt;br /&gt; The Neandeerthals disappeared as a specides over 30,000 years ago. However, our DNA says that each of us has a little bit of Neeanderthal inside. And trust me, DNA never lies!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These blurbs are framed as a discussion with your (junior, woman) colleague, Dr. Lovelace. &amp;lt;- I think that’s the name. I neglected to write it down and I don’t want to go back to level 1. Nod to computing history, but replicates power dynamics of 21st century archaeology (unwittingly?) Lovelace is there at the planet first, you the emminent professor appear on the scene. I need to go back &lt;a href=&quot;#todo:20&quot;&gt;and check if the player character is male&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Art work between the levels seems to imply that the bots are not aware that they are bots, that they are sentient, have culture, and wonder why the hell they’re doing these different things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Art work seems to reproduce some of the tropes of museum dioramas - mostly naked ‘cave people’, men armed, women looking on… but &lt;a href=&quot;#todo:0&quot;&gt;I need to replay that level&lt;/a&gt; (I think it was between 3 &amp;amp; 4 that I saw that art work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;game-play&quot;&gt;game play&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you’re presented with a map of the planet. Topography is represented; vegetation, slope, aspect etc all have an effect on how the bots move.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;configure the bots to meet the targets; targets have to be reached via particular times (denoted by a time bar; optimal times to hit your targets are coloured blue to white). Targets literally are places on the ground that the bots have to reach. If I could figure out &lt;a href=&quot;#todo:40&quot;&gt;how to take a screenshot on my damned tablet, I would&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bots have ‘evolution points’ which tally up the longer the bots live; you get a set amount when you start playing. They can be spent on mobility, reproduction, and technology. There are power-ups and boosts, but I’m not yet &lt;a href=&quot;#todo:30&quot;&gt;clear on how they work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A population graph keeps track of how well your bots are doing. They all die: mission is a failure and we haven’t learned how the Lovans managed this particular task.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other populations of bots are simulated; you can’t control them. But trouble ensues when your Lovans intersect with them. You know they’re bad, because they’r coloured red.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;initial-thoughts&quot;&gt;initial thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We make ABM in archaeology to simulate our understanding of how particular processes worked in the past. When the results of the simulation match the archaeology on the ground, we say we now have a good working model of process x. Or at least, that’s how it ought to work - too often we say we’re actually simulating x, rather than our just-so story of x. ABM per me is for testing our stories about the past, to get a range of possible behaviours, that allow us to explore and discount competing ideas - see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Preprint-Graham-and-Weingart.pdf&quot;&gt;Graham &amp;amp; Weingart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;this game does a good job of framing a narrative around what seems to be a basic &lt;a href=&quot;http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/RabbitsGrassWeeds&quot;&gt;rabbits-grass model&lt;/a&gt;, although it does have direction in it - ie, the player messes not just with the global population parameters (as is done in many ABM) but with the actual goal-setting of the agents in terms of their interaction with the environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;which brings up the interesting side effect that the act of making this ABM playable inadvertently (?) turns ‘evolving planet’ into ‘intelligent design’ (ugh.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-video-game-and-the-archaeologist&quot;&gt;The Video Game and the Archaeologist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell the colleagues in your department, in your company, that you play video games, and you will be greeted with one of only two reactions: a polite murmur accompanied by the dying look of ‘this person is not serious’, or the enthusiastic embrace of the true believer. There appears to be no middle ground. Yet, there is a long history of using games in education, in museum outreach, and in public archaeology. There is even a (much shorter) history of using games to persuade (as ‘serious games’ or ‘news games’). But there is practically no history at all of games being used to make a scholarly argument. This is to miss an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important however to ask, at the outset, what do games teach? What do games &lt;em&gt;do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The game, or any computer game for that matter, is ultimately about mechanics, and not about content. The content is window dressing, and deep playing of a game such as &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; teaches little about history, but everything about how to manipulate the complex algorithms that model the simulation” (Kee &amp;amp; Graham, 274)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us dispense with the notion that there is anything inherently gauche about archaeologists interested in the possibilities of video games, or any ‘natural’ reason why archaeology as a discipline should not be concerned with them. Manipulating algorithms, modelling societies through simulation: archaeologists have been doing this for years, within the ambit of GIS and Agent Based Models. The difference is, games have better eye-candy and production values. They should. Gaming as an industry generates more money than all of Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-potted-synopsis-of-game-studies&quot;&gt;A potted synopsis of game studies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly, there are two camps when it comes to analyzing the affective import of games. The ludologists, as the name implies, are interested in the rules of the games, the possibilities (or not) for action within the game. Narratologists on the other hand consider the story of the game, the story that emerges, or the story within which the game action takes place. Both approaches are useful for situating what a game does, or what a game achieves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another (rather archaeological) approach is to consider typologies of games. This is not to be confused with ‘genre’, as genres (‘first person shooter’; ‘rogue-like’; ‘management sim’; ‘casual’) are largely marketing categories that conflate issues of game play, or perspective, or agency, for the purposes of gaining space in the various venues where games are bought and sold. There is a voluminous literature on the typologies of games which try to distill essential features in order to understand the crucial ways in which games differ (the better to understand their narratological or ludological aspects). In the context of ‘historical’ games, a typology that helps us consider what aspects about the past we wish to communicate, to teach, focuses on categorizing how the game treats time and space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within ‘space’, we can ask how the game treats perspective, topography, and the environment. Within ‘time’, we can wonder about pace, representation, and teleology. The value of this kind of typology is that it would allow us consider our archaeological representations of space and time in that light, to work out what conventions of game design would be most affective in communicating the argument about the past that we wish to impart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;third-space&quot;&gt;Third Space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the neat breakdown between ‘narratology’ and ‘ludology’, which would seem to capture all there is to know about video games, there is a third space that games-about-history inhabit. Elliot and Kappel’s recent ‘Playing with the Past’ (2013) neatly captures this aspect. They point out that while games are systems of rules interpreted by the computer referee, and while these systems are enveloped within a narrative, games-about-the-past have a larger historical narrative &lt;em&gt;within which&lt;/em&gt; the game’s narrative must take place. That is to say, the players and designers are working within historical frameworks from the outset that inform their understanding of the past. Hence to make the game, to play the game, necessarily involves the kind of historical thinking (about contingency, about causality, about equifinality) that characterizes professional thinking about the past. ‘Why did that happen? What would happen if?’ are questions players ask about the game, which are very nearly the same thing that we ask of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is, while the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of a game is important, it is not as important as the system of rules and relationships that govern the emergent play; reflecting on &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; game play evolves the way it does forces the player to understand the rules of representation. This means that game players think about the past in ways that are the same as the kind of thinking about the past that we want in our students and publics. If one studies the communities of players that coalesce around particular games (especially games that allow for ‘modding’, or re-writing of the game rules, e.g, the &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; franchise), one finds quite heated discussions about how best to represent the past, debates over the consequences and meanings of modifications to the games, and - while maybe sometimes not the most factually informed debates - a keen understanding of &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;landscape-archaeology--the-digital-flaneur&quot;&gt;Landscape archaeology &amp;amp; the digital flaneur&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one particular kind of game that I think makes the inverse argument to my general thrust here; that is, the exception which proves the rule. So-called ‘walking simulators’ (a term of derision used by those who feel games should only be about killing things) are games where exploration and careful reading of the landscape are the prime mechanic (critically acclaimed examples include &lt;em&gt;Everyone’s Gone to the Rapture, Journey, Gone Home&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/em&gt; . In these games, the environments, the art work, the carefully modelled buildings and digital material culture matter far more than the mechanics (in the sense I outlined above). Anthony Masinton has pointed out that these are more akin to museum dioramas in that they are carefully constructed vignettes designed to tell a story (&lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt; might by these lights be the most archaeological game ever). I think these games are even more important than that; they are a kind of performed landscape archaeology. These games encourage a careful reading of the landscapes, and the material culture within those landscapes to tease out the story that happened before the player ever arrived. By contrast, games like the &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; series have beautiful reconstructions that make no real difference to the game play or the story. In these, they merely serve as backdrop for a digital &lt;em&gt;parkour&lt;/em&gt;, an experience of the past as digital &lt;em&gt;flaneur&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flow&quot;&gt;Flow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training of archaeologists has long had an emphasis on the practical - we learn &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to be archaeologists by &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; archaeology. We perform the learning. Where, and from whom, we learn the hands-on aspects of archaeology has a deep influence on how we think archaeologically, how we understand the past. This is of course why we speak of ‘schools’ of thought. To play a video game well involves that same aspect of performance, and the ‘who made this and how did they imagine the world’ matters equally as much. When we play a game well, we have internalized how that game represents its world. We have internalized an understanding of the system of rules and relationships that we &lt;em&gt;might not even be aware of&lt;/em&gt;. The learning that happens through video games is deep, and is tied to what psychologists call ‘flow’. Games don’t just represent a world: they actively watch the player. The best games adjust their difficulty in such a way as to achieve a flow state, a sense of mastery that sits in the sweet spot where the challenge is just hard enough to be difficult, but not so difficult that the player gives up in frustration. The best learning, in whatever context, is tied to that same sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In a nice connection with ‘media archaeology’, it is worth pointing out that &lt;em&gt;Space Invaders&lt;/em&gt;, a game that has had a pronounced influence on the world since its release in the late 1970s created a sense of flow completely as a side-effect of the physical nature of its processor. The processor was slow, and couldn’t render the graphics and sound required by the game at the start. The emergent outcome was that the game was easy to play at first as the aliens plodded along, but as the player shot them out of the sky processing resources were freed up, making the game run faster and become more challenging. There is a physicality to video games that we as archaeologists would do well to remember).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In representing a world to use, the system of rules and relationships that govern the emergent game play are akin to the systems of rules and relationships that we as scholars use to construct our ideas about the past: game rules &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; historiography. They &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; method and theory, all in one. In the same way that an agent based simulation of the past encodes our ideas about how phenomenon x worked in the past (so that we can see what the consequences are of that idea for household formation amongst the Anasazi, say) game rules do encode ideas about (inter alia) power, ideology, action, colonialism, and empire. The game theorist Ian Bogost calls these ‘procedural rhetorics’, the arguments made by code (2007); the historian William Urrichio explicitly called code historiography (2005). Games about the past will be played, experienced, and internalized by orders of magnitude more people than who ever read our formal archaeologies. And the experience will resonate far more deeply than any visit to a site or museum. We ignore games as a venue for our scholarship at our peril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-payoff&quot;&gt;The Payoff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been arguing by omission that the content, the window dressing (the pretty graphics; the hyper-realistic depictions of textures and atmospheres, the 3d sound, the voice acting) does not matter nearly as much as close experience and engagement with the code and its emergent outcomes. That engagements allows a connection here with the kind of archaeology argued for by scholars such as Stuart Eve (2014) that seeks to use the mechanics of games and allied technologies such as mixed or augmented realities to focus on understanding the systems of relationships amongst the full sensory experience of the past. Eve calls this an ‘embodied GIS’ which does not focus on the archaeologist’s subjective experience of place, but rather, explores how sound, views lighting (and indeed, smell and touch) combine or are constrained by the archaeology of a place, &lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt; in that place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests a way forward for the use of games as both a tool for research on the past, and a way to communicate that research to our various publics. Finally, we can turn our critical apparatus back to front and consider games as a venue within which we may &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; archaeology. Search online for ‘archaeogaming’. The most succinct definition of what this could be comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://gingerygamer.com/index.php/archaeogaming/&quot;&gt;Meghan Dennis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Archaeogaming is the utilization and treatment of immaterial space to study created culture, specifically through video games.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It requires treating a game world, a world bounded and defined by the limitations of its hardware, software and coding choices, as both a closed universe and as an extension of the external culture that created it. Everything that goes into the immaterial space comes from its external cultural source, in one way or another. Because of this, we see the same problems in studying culture in games as in studying culture in the material world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Archaeogaming is a subdiscipline that requires the same standards of practice as the physical collection of excavated data, only with a different toolset. It also provides the opportunity to use game worlds to reflect on practice, theory and the perceptions of our discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video games are an extraordinarily rich tool, area of research, and affective mode of communication whose possibilities we haven’t even begun to explore. Yet, they are not so foreign to the archaeologist’s ‘formal’ computational experience, with ties to GIS, Agent Based Models, and reconstructions. Play on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;tan_virtual_2009&quot;&gt;Tan, B.-K., and H. Rahaman. “Virtual Heritage: Reality and Criticism,” 2009. http://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/45499.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p 152- Tan’s suggestions, under ‘approaching the problem’ -&amp;gt; ‘in virtual heritage projects, digitalized artifacts somehow need to trigger the user’s cognitive process while that person is exploring the virtual environment,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://tan_virtual_2009#11&quot;&gt;Page 11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pg 152 - ‘While developing a virtual heritage environment we need to consider two important basic things: (a) Content development: Technology always has some constrains with hardware and software; as well as connected to an ‘image of practice’. Media experts like: modelers, animators, programmers may know how to do -pg 153-  something, but may not be aware of the implicit cultural values of a par- ticular artifacts or environment. So, while working as a cultural preserva- tionist, the implemented methods or approaches reflects their own assumptions and may not be appropriate (Kalay 2008). (b) User interpretation: Virtual environment allows more freedom and authority. Freedom in walkthrough and time-travel allows open-ended sequences of expedition. Such freedom on the other hand may become temporally, as well as spatially confused and to some extent result in ‘getting lost’ in some ancient and unknown world. So, effort should be given to contextualize the experience and set the mood for its understanding (Kalay 2008). A virtual environment thus need to become a ‘context’ where multiple and diverse cultural experiences may occur at different levels for different users (from layman to expert) according to their level of interpretation. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://tan_virtual_2009#11&quot;&gt;Page 11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pg 153 - ‘Copeland (1998, 2004) suggested a ‘constructivist approach’ for interpretation in an archaeological site. It is an approach of interpretation based on ‘learn- ing by doing’ through problem solving. Copeland explained the implication of constructivist approach as the way that individuals are constantly constructing meaning by their own thought, feeling, actions, negotiation and reaction with the world. Thus constructivist interpretation seeks to engage visitors with evidence and help them to construct their own meaning’ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://tan_virtual_2009#12&quot;&gt;Page 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p151 authors develop  a 3 step model where step 1 ‘documentation’ involves the tangible &amp;amp; intangible, but as we move to step 2 ‘representation’ constraints and distortion lead to data loss, and then as we move to stage 3 ‘dissemination’ we combine ‘media’ (hardware, software, narrative) which then the user interacts with. The user is the missing aspect - there is no consideration of ‘age, cultural background, ideology, perception, psychology, technical skill, learning ability, cognition’ in the design of virtual heritage. This model is drawn from ChanLIn 2001, Osberg 199, Roussou 2008.  This is all to say that there is a ‘lack of literature focused on the theory and methodology of user interaction and interpretation of heritage’ - designers dump information onto the user. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://tan_virtual_2009#10&quot;&gt;Page 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To virtualize heritage means to actualize the heritage content digitally and to simulate it using computer graphics technology.”  + that’s the thing right there, that word ‘actualize’. Need to unpack that. p144 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;sk://tan_virtual_2009#3&quot;&gt;Page 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“According to Addison (2000) there are three major domains in virtual heritage:
  - 3D Documentation: everything from site survey to epigraphy
  - 3D Representation: from historic reconstruction to visualization
  - 3D Dissemination: from immersive networked worlds to ‘in-situ’ augmented reality.” - p 146 &lt;br /&gt;
