<blockquote>
  <p>This page is a running log of my thoughts on my dissertation and eventual book manuscript. Ideas here might
 be convoluted and change frequently as my research direction changes.
 Interpretations here are provisional and dependent on research in progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Broadly speaking, my dissertation traces the environmental politics of Silicon Valley
between 1945 and 1990. Activists, residents, politicians, and business owners
all sought to shape the political structure of the changing urban environment,
and this highlights contests over space and who contested power over space at a
moment in time when the postindustrial economy was exerting enormous change upon
metropolitan regions.</p>

<h2 id="urban-environmentalism-in-silicon-valley">Urban Environmentalism in Silicon Valley</h2>

<p>I started with a seemingly simple question: Does nature matter to Silicon
Valley?</p>

<p>The story I plan to tell plays out in many metropolitan areas across the
United States. Many urban areas in the American West in particular
underwent dramatic economic development in the wake of the computer
economy’s appearance in metropolitan regions. Santa Clara County,
California, had 800 factory workers in 1950. By 1980, it had 264,000
manufacturing workers and three thousand electronics firms. By the 1980s
the West had become the center of atomic research, aerospace
manufacturing, and industries specializing in military control systems.
The information and electronics industries established roots in Dallas,
Portland, Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City, Boise, and Austin. Arizona,
for example, was profoundly affected by the new high tech industries
that were making the West their home. Electronics giant Motorola built a
plant in the late 1940s, attracted to the right-to-work laws,
pro-business attitude, and favorable tax climate. Within two decades,
electronics-aerospace firms such as Hughes Aircraft, General Electric,
and Honeywell moved in as well. Arizona shifted its traditional reliance
on the 3C’s – copper, cotton, and cattle – to become a key locale in
the corporate West.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">1</a></sup> By the 1980s, 40 percent of Arizona’s economy was
based on high tech industries and the state’s population ballooned to
3.1 million, a fourfold growth since 1945.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The urban West also attracted high levels of investment by the
military-industrial-academic complex through aerospace, computer, and academic
contracts. In 1967, James Clayton identified western states as being heavily
dependent on defense spending, concluding that “it is entirely possible that
defense spending will loom as the single most important economic and
demographic factor in the history of the West during the past two
decades.”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Clayton’s generalities were largely correct by the 1970s.
California had 24% of the prime military contracts in the country in 1959. In
1962, the Pacific Coast had 46% of all Defense Department contracts for
research and development. The interior states of the West also increased their
ties to the growing military-industrial complex, and these industries
attracted a better-educated workforce and urban populace. Urban westerners
were better educated than Americans overall: almost 46% of adults in the
metropolitan regions of the West were high school graduates in 1950, compared
to 34.3% in the rest of the nation.  As the national average rose over the
next two decades the West maintained its 10% edge. In 1960, Albuquerque, New
Mexico, boasted more Ph.D. degrees per capita than any other American
city.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Six of the ten metropolitan areas with the highest number of
civilian Department of Defense employees were western – San Antonio, Salt
Lake City, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Honolulu. Half of
metropolitan areas in the West received more in federal defense spending than
they paid in tax contributions for defense.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The focus on Silicon Valley helps illuminate the growing influence of
environmental politics in the United States. Throughout the postwar decades,
everyday residents of metropolitan regions began asking questions about their
environment, enough concerned about environmental change that local activists
movements emerged to challenge municipalities in unrestricted urban growth and
environmental degradation. I focus on a single locality and use a micro view of
western cities to understand how people created, influenced, or were affected by
urban change and culture. As Carl Abbott once reminded urban historians, “case
studies are the imperfect equivalents of experiments through which we test and
refine large-scale generalizations and theory.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">6</a></sup> The area under study is not
comprehensive of metropolitan change, but investigates the engagement between
economic development, urban growth, postindustrial change, and environmental
politics. The importance of local politics means an intensive examination of the
experiences in the metropolitan region and illustrates broader patterns of
environmental activism throughout the United States.</p>

<p>In addition to environmental politics and political culture, the project uses
<em>place and landscape</em> as a central point for analysis. Henri Lefebvre has noted that social
relations are cultural and spatial constructions.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">7</a></sup> So too are environmental
relations entirely defined by individual relationships to space and culture.
As Robert Self notes, people and communities do “not compete for resources for
abstract goals and purposes. They competed to put those resources to use to
create particular and concrete places.  . . . [People] called for very
specific things in relation to very specific places.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> The environmental
politics of Silicon Valley were tied to spatial politics.</p>

<h3 id="suburban-environmentalism">Suburban Environmentalism</h3>

<p>My work engages with the suburban origins of environmentalism identified by previous scholars, among them <a href="/rome2001bulldozer/">rome2001bulldozer</a>, <a href="/sellers2012crucible/">sellers2012crucible</a>, <a href="/mozingo2011pastoral/">mozingo2011pastoral</a>, and <a href="/klingle2007emerald/">klingle2007emerald</a>. Much of the criticism leveled against industrial and urban growth by suburbanites was couched in the language of the countryside and idealism of country living.</p>

<p>Yet the research also intersects with the histories of postwar liberalism and conservatism. Rather than bastions of conservative political thought narrated by <a href="/mcgirr2006warriors/">mcgirr2006warriors</a> and others, I see the suburbs in Silicon Valley as harbingers of a suburban liberalism. Suburbanites of the Valley maintained a belief in the role of government, quality-of-life, civil rights, and environmental quality in their communities.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-capitalism">History of Capitalism</h3>

<p>Still thinking through this and I’ll fill this out more as I confront the issues further. Some initial notes are in <a href="/nature-and-suburbs/#potential-directions">20141112 - Suburbs and Nature#potential-directions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gis">GIS</h3>

<p>I am interested in GIS methods for historical research, so I am exploring how
GIS might be used in my research. I am looking at <code>R</code> to construct
maps that attempt to track the movement of people into and out of Santa Clara
Valley and using D3.js for building interactive scholarly works. I am keeping
a <a href="/gis-log/">GIS Log</a> of my work as I go along.</p>

<p>My current thinking about building such maps are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Most histories of Silicon Valley pay little attention to the area before it
became the center of technological entrepreneurship and research. The Valley
was originally farmland owned by Leland Stanford and leased to Stanford
University, which could use the land in any way it saw fit. Before the
1950s, land was leased out to farmers. Only with Frederick Terman’s tenure
as Dean of Engineering did the land start getting leased to non-agricultural
businesses. How does this process play out? How does the landscape transform
around Stanford as urban development moves in?</li>
  <li>Relatedly, the story of Silicon Valley places Stanford at the epicenter and
suggests that high tech companies begin to radiate out from the university
throughout the rest of the Valley. My hunch is that isn’t actually the
case—that high tech was attractive to Stanford <em>and</em> other municipalities
in the Bay Area. San Jose, for example, is chasing investment by high tech
at the same time Stanford does. How can I map these things out? I’ve started
to <a href="https://github.com/hepplerj/machinesvalley/blob/gh-pages/data-files/sv-companies/sv_companies.csv">collect a database of tech
companies</a>
in order to map where these companies are in space and time.</li>
  <li>A central political debate in the 1970s was disappearing open space, which
eventually gave way to anti-growth legislation and new restrictions on urban
growth. Where and do what extent are open spaces / green spaces established
throughout the Peninsula?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="network-analysis">Network analysis</h3>

<p>I am interested in the relationships among people and institutions. I am looking
at using network analysis to examine the social connections between activists,
business leaders, politicians, and institutions such as universities,
environmental  organizations, and community organizations. How these might play
out I am unsure of, but the visualization might show interesting connections
between people in the community that suggests something about how people and
organizations worked together. I am keeping a <a href="/network-log/">Network Log</a> to track my work
as I go along.</p>
