<p>I really like this idea of iterating through the rubric with the students. Pulling this off not for the faint of heart I suspect.

  <p>y position as a tenured, academic archaeologist provides a distinct professional context for slow archaeology. My efforts to develop slow archaeology come from a position of privilege. As an academic archae-ologist, I rely on his research for professional advancement, but not professional survival. Tenure provides opportunities for a more delib-erate pace toward publication</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while this is good to recognize, I think it underplays the rhetorical weapon we hand folks by insisting on ‘slow’ archaeology. Oh those out-of-touch professors! Also, the vast majority of archaeologists do not have this luxury.

</blockquote>

<p>those who emphasize ‘efficiency’ are often of the computational archaeological type. If we accept or imagine that there is a difference between comp.archae and digiarch then we are here charging at the wrong target?

<p>the elephant here I guess is that we don’t discuss archaeology’s long history with spatial computing, which is where folks like Huggett see a point of intersection. https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/41636599.pdf</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sicists are not so distinctive as to warrant a separate “classical informatics”.  Both Terras (2010, 187) and Rabinowitz (2011) see digital classics as more of an emergent field still in its early stages, while Cayless (2011) describes it as  an underground movement, with some very high-profile projects and practitioners operating within a more generally hostile attitude towards digital ways of knowing
