83471_2008-01-23.txt:THE EQUITY was surprised to learn the results of the most recent 2006 census update, which listed over 2,000 local people as having identified themselves as aboriginal.
83471_2008-01-23.txt:This area of Canada is among the oldest in terms of when it was settled. It makes sense that the older generations of families would have ties to aboriginals and those ties may have continued down family lines.
83471_2008-01-23.txt:Considering the hardships endured by aboriginal people in Canada, the shame some felt about their status in their country led many to disown their heritage. Those tribulations have been well-documented but it seems a corner has been turned in terms of taking pride in aboriginal lineage.
83471_2008-01-23.txt:Knowing now that so many of us consider ourselves aboriginal, perhaps it?s time for us to pay more attention to the issues surrounding this segment of the population.
83471_2008-01-23.txt:A prominent member of the Pontiac aboriginal community, Lise Romain, said there are important issues like housing and health that should be addressed.

83471_2008-01-23.txt:THE EQUITY regularly attends events celebrating the myriad other cultures in Pontiac: English, French, Scottish,German, Polish and Irish all come to mind with ease, but we would be interested in learning more about the aboriginal community?s heritage and culture.

83471_2008-06-25.txt:Did fur traders and aboriginals stick to the Ontario shores while paddling their way down the river? Of course not, so it seems silly that the river?s historical and cultural values will only be recognized in Ontario, but not in Qu?bec.
83471_2008-08-20.txt:A: People (and I include aboriginal people in this). Our species has a habit of spreading out across various habitats, destroying the natural elements wherever it develops permanent populations and producing long-term landscape damage that is slow to recover. I?m only being partially tongue-in-cheek here, but we certainly behave like an invasive species and have for millennia. It would be hard to select a number one ?wild? bad guy because their impacts are not the same, but I?d put something most people don?t even know about right up there. Canary-grass (Phalaris arund-inacea) is an agricultural grass that now dominates thousands of hectares of disturbed Ottawa River marshlands. It is much more ecologically intrusive ? especially in the lower river valley, than the overly-publicized Purple Loosestrife. The jury is still out on the newly arrived Water Chestnut; if it does not do well in more acidic waters, like Purple Loosestrife and European Water-milfoil, it likely will only become a locally significant problem in the lower watershed. European Carp is a bad one, so is Zebra Mussels (another lower watershed threat) ... the list goes on.

83471_2010-06-23.txt:Now think of the current reality in Canada and Australia. Our colonial leaders did not perpetuate 100 per cent genocide Instead, they practiced deliberate, forced assimilation, relocation, residential schooling and other means of denying a people their identity Now, as descendents of colonizers, even in 2010 we simply do not have a workable, proven system that shows us how to fairly deal with aboriginal cultures
83471_2010-08-18.txt:tiers and that they maimed and lived with the aboriginal people of this land gives me a powerful sense of belonging Canada is often referred to, by the world, as a peaceful prosperous nation, and so it is, but this country and its greatness was earned and built by our ancestors. To a large degree, we have been gifted by those we have never met, but who were determined to build a better life and a better future for their children. 1 am sure that this lesson is repeated over and over again across our great land.
83471_2010-09-01.txt:Aquaculture permitted them to remain as all-season residents of this land rather than being nomadic, as were most other aboriginal peoples in Australia.
