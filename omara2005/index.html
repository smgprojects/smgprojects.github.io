<h5><span id="omara2005cities">O’Mara, Margaret Pugh. <i>Cities Of Knowledge: Cold War Science and the Search for the Next Silicon Valley</i>. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005.</span></h5>

<p>O’Mara’s launching point is a question: why was Silicon Valley successful while other attempts to replicate its success have failed? She uses three intense case studies to examine the causes and factors that play into its success. Using Stanford University/Palo Alto, the University of Pennsylvania/Philadelphia, and Georgia Tech/Atlanta, she seeks to understand how these institutions succeeded or failed in their attempts to become “cities of knowledge.” What defines a city of knowledge includes a physical community, anchored by a research institution that can capitalize on relationships between the university (and its federal research grants) and innovative companies transforming their theoretical research into applied technologies. O’Mara finds that the relationships between the local economy, landscape, and demographics were primed to serve government-funded university research initiatives.</p>

<p>Each case study carefully examines the goals of university administrators, local governments, businesses, and high tech workers. The baseline case of Stanford (private and suburban) succeeds with its strengths in physics and engineering, entrepreneurial flexibility, abundant land for development, and racial homogeneity in the surrounding communities. These advantages are not shared in her other case studies of Penn and Georgia Tech; Penn faced resistance to urban renewal, Georgia Tech was constrained by the state higher education system, and both Penn and Georgia Tech faced resistance from African American neighbors or confronted the preference of city elites to develop for white suburbs.</p>

<p>The success of Silicon Valley shows how a combination of Cold War military research dollars, land-planning models, and access to property allowed cities of knowledge to prosper. By reconsidering the research park and postwar American suburbanization, O’Mara finds these cities are not simply cases of unrestricted suburban sprawl. Cities of knowledge brought together highly educated researchers and entrepreneurs who took advantage of new partnerships between universities and businesses. The research university forms the core of her narrative. These institutions served as leaders in the development of high-tech communities. Urban historians have examined the factor of metropolitan dispersal as part of Cold War planning, and O’Mara shows how defense procurements favored companies with suburban locations. Her work ties in with urban historians who have examined the story of central city decline, especially Lizabeth Cohen, Thomas Sugrue, Robert Self, and Becky Nicolaides.</p>

<p>O’Mara doesn’t examine Harvard University or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both of which also benefited from Cold War defense imperatives due to ties to the Manhattan Project’s co-chairs, Harvard President James B. Conant and MIT Vice President Vannevar Bush. O’Mara could have discussed the unreachable standards of Boston’s Route 128 technology corridor, but rather she is interested in how Stanford became the gold standard for other institutions. Her work also begs for more research: how does Stanford’s private, suburban success stack up against a public, suburban university? Can a flagship state university sustain new tech capitals? Can high tech companies generate development of a city of knowledge without a major research university?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Are biomedical complexes and health industries part of the “cities of knowledge”?</p>

<p>My main interest is in her first three chapters. Chapter 1 examines the Cold War politics, Chapter 2 looks at multiversities, cities, and suburbs, and Chapter 3 looks at Stanford University.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Cities of knowledge are “engines of scientific production, filled with high-tech industries, homes for scientific workers and their families, with research universities at their heart.” Cities of knowledge “made the metropolitan areas in which they were located more economically successful during the twentieth century, and they promise to continue to do so in the twenty-first.” (p. 1)</p>

<p>p. 1: Cities of knowledge are “the ultimate post-industrial city.”</p>

<p>To understand why high technology thrives in different regions, O’Mara suggests looking at the evolution spatially and historically. The cities are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>consciously planned communities that were physical manifestations of a particular political and cultural moment in history, and shaped by the relationship between the state and civil society in late twentieth-century America. The city of knowledge was a creation of the Cold War, whose policies and spending priorities transformed universities, created vibrant new scientific industries, and turned the research scientist into a space-age celebrity. And it was a product of the suburban age, when economic realignments, demographic changes, and public subsidiaries transformed patterns of living, working, and economic opportunity. (pp. 1-2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Research universities were central to the process, serving as urban planner, economic development leader, and political actor. The government-university relationship not only transformed the internal – the internal workings and research priorities of universities – but transformed the external – land management and economic development in the communities where institutions were located. (p. 2)</p>

<p>p. 2: “intersections of policy and place, and the role of universities within this process”</p>

<p>High technology location choices also considered where workers wanted to live. Because of this, high tech clusters in the “most affluent, and economically homogenous, places in the country.” (pp. 2-4). The connection to wealth and high technology “explain the infrequent exceptions to the suburban trend at the end of the twentieth century, which occurred after cities began to regain some of the wealth and middle-class residents they had lost to the suburbs decades earlier.” (p. 4)</p>

<p>O’Mara is placing the history of high technology into a “larger history of postwar urban and industrial change, [and] we can trace the institutional and political origins of these fundamental – and inherently contradictory – geographic and socioeconomic characteristics and understand why they have been so economically important.” High tech growth was “a process of city building.” (p. 4)</p>

<p>O’Mara draws these conclusions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cities of knowledge are products of Cold War spending patterns. (p. 3)</li>
  <li>Cities of knowledge are the product of university-centered economic development policies. (p. 6)</li>
  <li>Cities of knowledge are the product of local action. (p. 7)</li>
</ol>

<p>Stanford set the model for university-driven high-tech development, although its success occurred within a set of extraordinary circumstances. Stanford, “blessed with a massive endowment of undeveloped and economically desirable land, entrepreneurial administrators, and location near key defense facilities and amid one of the nation’s more rapidly growing affluent suburban areas, Stanford built a research park adjacent to its campus that became, in the eyes of many government officials and university administrators, the gold standard.” (p. 8)</p>

<p>p. 9: “The choice of postwar policy makers to implement science policy through a loose and decentralized network of academic and industrial partners and interest groups, rather than through consolidated state power, was consistent with other aspects of U.S. welfare-state formation and economic policy – and a marked contrast to other industrialized nations.”</p>

<p>p. 10: The city of knowledge was a “quintessentially American form, and is one that developed because of – not in spite of – the federalized and privatized American political system.”</p>

<p>p. 10: The Cold War required a strong state, but American political culture demanded a weak one. The solution was to “empower universities and scientific industries to become agents and partners with the federal government.”</p>

<p>p. 11: “The case of the city of knowledge attests to how much the federal government <em>did</em> provide, and how these subsidies were disguised to such a degree that they often went unrecognized by their beneficiaries. These ‘strong-state-as-weak-state’ policy frameworks – from basic research policy to economic development incentives to tax and infrastructure subsidies – allowed local actors to shape policy and tailor public funds to meet their own ends.”</p>

<p>Quotes Daniel Bell, p. 12: “If the dominant figure of the past hundred years have been the entrepreneur, the businessman, and the industrial executive, the ‘new men’ are the scientists, the mathematicians, the economists, and the engineers of the new intellectual technology.”</p>

<p>p. 13: “The complex interactions between public and private created frameworks and incentives for high-technology production that moved the most rapidly growing sectors of the economy to the low-density, affluent fringe of the metropolis and redefined the American city for a post-industrial Information Age.”</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>

<p>Cities of knowledge came to be because of Cold War opportunities presented to
research universities, and cities of knowledge came to be located where they
were because of Cold War strategic concerns intersecting with economic concerns,
how power and money were distributed institutionally and geographically, and how
the Cold War defense complex grew. (17)</p>

<p>Cold War R&amp;D encompassed a wide array of government activity. The majority of
the work was “applied” research “conducted for the purposes of developing
technology with specific, relatively short-term military or commercial uses. The
remainder was ‘basic’ research: scientific inquiry conducted for the sake of
greater scientific understanding.” (18)</p>

<p>The Cold War R&amp;D focus was a significant shift in university-government
relations. During the 1920s and 1930s universities tended to be suspicious of
federal government involvement and operated on the belief that “the less
a scholarly project was influenced by nonacademic interests, the higher the
quality of the scholarship.” (18)</p>

<p>Prior to the Cold War, private industry was “the center of the action when it
came to the research and development of new technology.” But the outbreak of
World War II required the rapid production of military technology, and
government officials and university administrators flocked to federal research
grants and contracts. The Roosevelt Administration established the Office of
Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) to handle wartime research efforts,
and over the course of the war funded hundreds of military projects. (19)</p>

<p>Quoting President Eisenhower in a postwar memorandum titled “Scientific and
Technological Resources As Military Assets”: “Scientists and industrialists must
be given the greatest possible freedom to carry out their research . . . [They]
are more likely to make new and unsuspected contributions to the development of
the Army if detailed directions are held to a minimum.” (quoted, 20)</p>

<p>p. 20: “As U.S.-Soviet tensions headed up over the course of the late 1940s,
government officials recognized that research was fundamental to preparedness.”</p>

<p>Vannevar Bush was an important figure in securing government money for
university research. In July 1945 he published <em>Science, The Endless Frontier</em>
to argue that “scientific innovation would be essential to political and
economic success in the postwar world, and recommended that the federal
government establish a National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund scientific
education and basic research in universities.” His choice of a foundation made
clear his desire that the new entity not be another federal bureaucracy but “an
independent body run by professional scientists rather than federal bureaucrats,
whose mission centered on the promotion of basic research.” (21)</p>

<p><strong><em>[Thought: I find the frontier language interesting here. Bush writes: “The
pioneer spirit is still vigorous within this nation. Science offers a largely
unexplored hinterland for the pioneer who has the tools for his task. The
rewards of such exploration both for the Nation and the individual are great.
Scientific progress is one essential key to our security as a nation, to our
better health, to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to our national
progress.”^[Vannevar Bush, *<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm">Science, The Endless Frontier</a></em>.]
]</strong>*</p>

<p>Early government support for applied research highlighted a tenant of
“hands-off” approach by the government: the government provided the funds, but
let the scientists and industry retain control over the execution. Furthermore,
however, these early government funding methods highlighted what O’Mara calls
“institutional exclusivity.” She uses the examples of ENIAC and RAND to note
that the conversations in Washington revolved around a small pool of scientists
at top research universities (especially centering around Harvard and MIT).
Congressional proposals were submitted to encourage a distribution of resources
and improve institutional competitiveness, but most of these efforts remained
stalled. Instead, high-ranked institutions became more aggressive and
entrepreneurial in their lobbying efforts. Effective lobbying meant having
a permanent office in Washington. One of the earliest universities to establish
a permanent Washington office was Stanford (in 1945). (26-27)</p>

<p>Another significant factor in the selection of research universities for federal
research initiatives was dispersion. O’Mara notes that “scientists, business
leaders, city and regional planners, military tacticians, and national
politicians alike seized upon the idea of urban decentralization as an important
and crucial way to combat the threat of outside nuclear attack.” (29) Industrial
dispersion received its first federal endorsement with the National Security Act
of 1947, which created the National Security Resources Board (NSRB) which, among
other security defense duties, was charged with “the strategic relocation of
industries, services, government, and economic activities, the continuous
operation of which is essential to the Nation’s security.” (quoted, 29)</p>

<p>Additionally, the idea of dispersion was consistent with a pro-growth and
pro-decentralization approach to many local business coalitions. O’Mara quotes
a San Francisco Bay Area Council director of city planning: “It is more than
a great piece of good fortune for city planners that policies which best serve
the nation’s security are also best for urban development. . . . We claim that
this is good for our people and economical for our industry and business.”
(quoted, 33)</p>

<p>Conversations about dispersal revealed two important political realities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“The Cold War effort turned the federal government into an immensely powerful
customer of industry and gave it a vested interest in where its contractors
located within a given metropolitan area.” (34)</li>
  <li>“Economic, social, and spatial changes in mid-twentieth-century American
cities created a political context in which these efforts were welcomed and
encouraged, and gave the effort crucial outside support and political
momentum.” (34)</li>
</ol>

<p>p. 35: “Dispersion arrived on the domestic policy agenda at a moment when
political and business leaders were not only embracing decentralization as
a sensible economic and social strategy, but were also turning their attention
to the physical renewal and redevelopment of older urban centers.”</p>

<p>High-tech company contracts with the military: “By 1957 federal funds made up 61
percent of electronics industry R&amp;D, 54 percent of communication industry R&amp;D,
and 30 percent of R&amp;D dollars in the professional and scientific instrument
industry. Manufacturers of specialized electronics equipment and other
sophisticated technologies were in many cases kept afloat entirely because of
military research and development grants.” (43)</p>

<p>p. 44: “Dispersion was, in effect, a politcal endorsement of the idea that
defense-critical work – of which scientific research was a central element –
was best conducted away from the urbanized commercial center.”</p>

<p>Federal spending on R&amp;D: “Between 1950 and 1955, R&amp;D expenditures more than
tripled, reaching over $3.3 billion, or 3.3 percent of the entire U.S. budget.”
(45)</p>

<p>Another perceived crisis encouraged more government-sponsored basic research.
The launch of Sputnik in 1957 led American political leaders to conclude that
American scientific education lagged behind the Soviets despite great
investments in scientific research since World War II. In response, Congress and
President Eisenhower increased overall funds for research and provided more
support for educational and research activities. One of those proposed funding
measures was increased funding for the NSF, whose budget nearly tripled in 1959
to $136 million. Other federal funding streams increased as well. In 1955, the
government spent $286 million on basic research. By 1960 the sum had doubled to
$693 million; by 1965 the figure was nearly $1.6 <em>billion</em>. Between 1955 and
1965, basic research had grown from 8 percent to 12 percent of the total R&amp;D
budget. (47)</p>

<p>In 1963, the Higher Education Facilities Act was passed which provided “generous
federal grants and loans for facility construction at all kinds of colleges and
universities. Administered by the states, the program paid one-third of the
construction costs of science and engineering facilities and offered loans up to
three-fourths of the cost of any kind of campus facility, for scientific purpose
or not.” (49)</p>

<p>The increase of the federal largess was not distributed evenly institutionally.
The majority of R&amp;D money flowed to a small pool of contractors and a small and
elite group of unviersities. Corporations and research institutions who won
defense spending and contracts in the 1950s and 1960s remained relatively
unchanged twenty years later. For research institutions, government spending
followed established patterns where scientific capacity was capable of the
research desired. In 1939 and 1965, the same group of twenty-five
universities (fifteen private and ten public) was responsible for producing
two-thirds of the nation’s Ph.D.s in science. (52)</p>

<p>Furthermore, R&amp;D funds were not distributed evenly geographically. O’Mara notes
there were “dramatic geographical inequities in the distribution of military
installations, defense-production facilities, and R&amp;D resources.” (53) The South
and the West won the majority of defense contracts, reflecting the patterns of
political power in Congress. Southern Democrats and Pacific West Congressional
leaders controlled defense policy and appropriations processes, and steered the
majority of federal money to their home districts. (53-54)</p>

<p>p. 54: “In this way, the pork-barrel politics of Cold War spending became
a major driver of a massive shift of population and employment from the
Northeast and Midwest – the Rustbelt – to the Sunbelt states of the South and
West.”</p>

<p>Institutional favoritism and geographic favoritism concentrated in certain parts
of the country:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By 1963 one official estimated that only one hundred of the nation’s two
thousand institutions of higher education participated in federal research
programs. Fifty percent of the nation’s scientists worked in only six states:
California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The
Western states had twice the density of engineers per million than the South,
and 50 percent more than the Midwest. Of the $1.5 billion given in fiscal year
1963 to colleges and universities for scientific research, California
institutions alone received 28.6 percent of the total. In contrast, the
entire Midwest received only 13.9 percent. (54)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>p. 57: “If a university had prestige and research capacity <em>and</em> was located in
a defense-rich regional economy, it found itself particularly well positioned to
take advantage of the rich financial opportunities created by the Cold War
science complex, and to turn these opportunities into catalysts of local and
regional economic growth.”</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>

<p>O’Mara explores how universities became drivers of economic development. She
notes that “large research universities were now institutions that, if they
chose, could have a dramatic impact on the shape and composition of regional
development.” (58)</p>

<p>Three tensions ran through the engagement of universities in economic development:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Location. As America suburbanized, most prominent research institutions
remained in cities. Urban universities became “economic saviors who might be
able to stem the exodus of middle-class residents and white-collar jobs.”
(58)</li>
  <li>Spatial. The university turns its focus outward, engaged in politics, became
charged with greater social and economic responsibilities, but remained an
exclusive place whose mission in part was predicated on separation from the
outside world.</li>
  <li>Definition. The “research university” was a term used to describe many types
of institutions, which included top-ranked universities with a bulk of R&amp;D
contracts, and low- to middle-ranked schools attempting to break into the
elite group. These schools were distributed in cities, suburbs, small towns,
the Sunbelt and the Rustbelt. And the definition included private and public
schools. “A university’s ability to act as a positive force for regional
economic-development depended greatly on where it fell within this broad
definition – a distinction that often was lost on the federal, state, and
local leaders attempting to build industrial development strategies around
these institutions.” (59)</li>
</ol>

<p>Ideas about campus planning traditions extended beyond the academy, particularly
in white-collar industrial laboratories. General Electric was among the first
major American companies to develop a researck park when it built Nela Park
outside Cleveland in 1913. Bell Laboratories suburban facility in New Jersey
likewise served as a prewar example of the research park that drew upon the
idyllic and pastoral architecture and design of campuses: low density architecture, extensive
green space, and so on. (61-63)</p>

<p>p. 63: “After 1945, technological changes, economic realignments, and federal
infrastructure and tax programs made the suburbs more desirable – and
economically efficient – locations for households and firms. . . . The
fastest-growing job centers were metropolitan areas that also happened to be
suburbanizing the most rapidly; Los Angeles was highest in growth among the
nation’s nine largest metropolitan areas, with an over 77 percent increase in
manufacturing employment. The old industrial capitals had more sluggish growth
– Philadelphia had roughly 3 percent, for example – or lost jobs, like
Detroit, Boston, and Pittsburgh.”</p>

<p>The growth of industrial parks coincided with the low-rise and spatially
deconcentrated facilities of U.S. industrial architecture. In 1940, the US had
thirty-three industrial parks, which rose to 302 parks by 1957. As parks
increased in number, they became less likely to locate within the political
boundaries of cities. Around 75 percent of parks built after World War II were
located in cities with populations between 25,000 and 500,000 people. Most parks
were privately sponsored and developed by large consortia of landowners and real
estate developers. (64)</p>

<p>As industry moved to the suburbs, land developers recognized the need for parks
to adhere to higher design standards. Affluent suburbs especially needed
sensible design; homeowners might welcome tax revenues from new industry, but
were unwilling to live next to smokestacks. The Arthur D. Little, Inc., real
estate consultantcy in New Hampshire noted in January 1958:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An industrial park is a planned or organized industrial district with
a comprehensive plan which is <em>designed to insure compatibility between the
industrial operations therein and the existing activities and character of the
community</em> in which the park is located. The plan must provide for streets
designed to facilitate truck and other traffic, proper setbacks, lot size
minimums, land/use ratio minimums, architectural provisions, landscaping
requirements, and specific use requirements, all for the purposes of
<em>promoting the degrees of openness and park-like character which are
appropriate to harmonious integration into the neighborhood</em>. The industrial
park must be of sufficient size and must be suitably zoned to protect the
areas surrounding it from being devoted to lower uses. (quoted, 65)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>p. 66: “The principles of separation, isolation, and pastoralism that guided the
physical shape and location of both the campus and the industrial park had
important spatial ramifications for science-based economic development”</p>

<p>By the end of the 1950s new industrial parks were being drawn away from the city
center to the suburbs. Businesses enjoyed new tax benefits, close proximity to
a workforce, away from congestion, avoided aging infrastructure, and avoided
union members in older industrial cities. Not all firms suburbanized: a 1957
report by the U.S. Department of Commerce noted the growth of office buildings
in the city centers outpaced suburban development. There were also benefits for
remaining in city centers, such as being close to services like banks and public
transportation  (66)</p>

<p>The emergence of research parks were distinctive from industrial parks primarily
in their relationship with higher education institutions. (69)</p>

<p>O’Mara concludes with three points about institutional and geographic distinctions
that influenced the kinds of economic development efforts could succeed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“The growth of scientific industry coincided with a giant suburban building
boom, making it easier and much more economically attractive for scientific
firms and workers to locate in suburbs rather than cities.” (92-93)</li>
  <li>“This type of economic development policy revolved around the American
university, an institution that had grown – and thrived – around the idea
that separation and isolation were crucial to intellectual innovation.” (93)
These universities were historically elite, inward-looking, pastoral places.</li>
  <li>“All universities were not created equal. Some entered into the economic
development game with vastly more resources and political power than others.”
(93)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Federal policy choices affected the size, shape, and composition of
university-centered communities. The most influential of these was Stanford
University and the suburban communities of California’s San Francisco Peninsula.
O’Mara seeks to understand the region’s influence on the “development of federal
policy related to science-based economic development strategy, and on the
development of other high-tech regions themselves.” (97)</p>

<h3 id="uniqueness-of-stanford">Uniqueness of Stanford</h3>

<p>Stanford was unique in its ability to become the capital of high tech industry;
not only was Stanford successful in attracting federal monies for R&amp;D but it was
an important and influential land developer. The centerpiece of Stanford’s real
estate development was its research park, whose architecture and design
standards became a model for other industrial parks. Replicating the “miracle of
Palo Alto” was nearly impossible because other urban environments had little in
common with Stanford’s bucolic suburban landscape and advantage amid a booming
economy. (98)</p>

<p>Stanford and the Bay Area provides a picture of how concurrent forces of
suburbanization and the Cold War science complex together shaped the
low-density, decentralized geography of high-tech production. (98)</p>

<p>Population figures in the Bay Area:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Between 1940 and 1947 the nine-county region became home to 676,000 more people, 330,000 more jobs, and $2.5 billion more in annual income. Per capital wealth became the highest in the nation; between 1940 and 1945 individual incomes increased by 66 percent. (103)</li>
</ul>

<p>Quoting a Bay Area Council publication: “Close contacts between Federal and
private business groups built up during the war should be continued and
strengthened. . . . Government business – Federal, State, and local – is a big
business in the Bay Area and is a vital factor in its economy.” (quoted, 105)</p>

<p>The Bay Area Council became pro-suburban in its outlook, recognizing the limits
of possible development for San Francisco (“[the city] has reached its peak in
residence and industrial sites”, p. 105), began thinking about the Peninsula as
“an integrated economic unit . . . [the counties] not only interrelated but are
interdependent.” (quoted, 105), all of which points to how suburban areas were
becoming important for economic development. (104-105).</p>

<p>The Council also recognized the spatial needs of industry, especially in the age
of automobiles. The Council became pro-suburban and promoted industrial
development in outer areas of metropolitan areas. They likewise reflected the
pro-dispersal and pro-decentralization characteristics of the Cold War. (105)</p>

<p>p. 106: “The leaders of the Bay Area Council also saw that California was going
to find its economic niche not through replication of the industrial pattern of
the Northeastern and Midwestern United States but in fostering the growth of
‘new’ industries whose employees would be attracted to a good climate, beautiful
landscape, and cultural amenities.” The Council emphasizes the cultural and
environmental amenities of the region.</p>

<p>In 1945, as the Council thought about these issues, Stanford was very much
a regional institution. Despite the Bay Area being a central player in defense
R&amp;D, most projects of war occurred elsewhere in the area. Frederick Terman, who
served as the first dean of engineering at Stanford, noted: “Stanford emerged
from World War II as an underprivileged institution.” (quoted, 106)</p>

<p>Terman and other Stanford administrators set to change the mission of Stanford
and reshape the surrounding suburb into a center for technological and
scientific companies in their highly educated workforce. The University had
several advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The University’s location amid a booming Cold War economy. The Bay Area had
military spending, middle-class suburbanization, and private-sector wealth.
Palo Alto and Menlo Park were home to upper-middle-class families. Menlo Park
grew from just over 3,000 people to nearly 27,000 between 1940 and 1960; Palo
Alto grew from under 17,000 to over 52,000 in the same period. But commercial
activity occurred elsewhere on the Peninsula, and almost always took the form
of retail and service firms. (107)</li>
  <li>The University capitalized on the presence of a few, small spin-off
technology companies like Hewlett-Packard and Varian Associates. These
advanced technology companies, ecological, infrastructural, and demographic
conditions all served to create a new economic base that the research
programs at Stanford sought to take advantage. (107)</li>
  <li>Stanford also had an advantageous political position, having close ties with
local civic leaders and the political ascendancy of scientists in government
affairs (e.g., Terman was a student of Vannevar Bush). Stanford leaders also
were members of the San Francisco civic elite; university presidents were
automatically invited to join the Bohemian Club, many city leaders were
Stanford alumni, and Stanford administrators were attune to regional
economic development. (108)</li>
</ol>

<p>p. 108: “The business associonalism of the regional elite colored Univeristy
leaders’ attitudes about government intervention, but like their allies in
organizations like the Bay Area Council, the university was quick th recognize
the central role of government spending in the local economy.”</p>

<p>By the end of the 1940s, Stanford was active in seeking federal grants</p>

<ul>
  <li>Over the course of the 1950s, Stanford’s income from federal grants rose steadily from less than $2 million in 1951 to $8.3 million in 1960. The majority of grants came from the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission and largely were awarded to the School of Engineering. (109)</li>
  <li>Terman and other administrators recognized that federal grants and contracts not only helped the national defense, but also aided the university in seeding money for industrial innovation. (109)</li>
  <li>Stanford increased its reputation by also aggresively recruting faculty from Ivy League schools on the East Coast. So successful had Stanford been that <em>Newsweek</em> quoted a professor in 1961 saying he left Harvard to come to Stanford “because interesting things are happening . . . there’s excitement in the air.” (quoted, 109)</li>
</ul>

<p>O’Mara quotes <em>The Tall Tree</em>, a journal sponsored in part by the Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce in 1958:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Palo Alto-Stanford research community has grown to become an integral part
of the science community of the nation. . . . These United States resources of
science are tapped by the armed services in continent-spanning teamwork for
defense. . . . This brings Stanford research and the laboratories of industry
here into sharp focus in their considerable dependence on the armed services
and federal funds.” (quoted, 110)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="stanford-residential-development">Stanford Residential Development</h3>

<p>Part of Stanford’s success was in its ability to engage in land development.
Wallace Sterling, the president of the University beginning in 1949, initiated
land development campaigns. Under the leadership of the historian Sterling,
Stanford became a science-based economic developer. (112)</p>

<p>Campus planning and development formed an example of the relationship between
decentralizing planning and places for scientific production. Just as Leland
Stanford had hired the preeminent designer of his day – Frederick Law Olmsted
– Sterling hired the famous urbanist Lewis Mumford in 1947 to assess
development options for Stanford and its surrounding lands. (112)</p>

<p>Leasing lands to high tech industrial development gave the University
flexibility in determining residential development Industrial firms could be
easily persuaded to sign 51-year or 99-year contracts. But Stanford
administrators also wanted the University to “develop a community in which work,
home, recreation, and cultural life are brought together with some degree of
balance and integration.” (quoted, 115) Univeristy leaders responded to such
demands by embarking on a building program in mid-1950s that included high-end
housing, a large regional shopping center, and an industrial park made up of
businesses and manufacturers who would benefit from close proximity to Stanford.
(115)</p>

<p>In the 1950s, political tensions existed between town-and-gown. Outwardly, the
town assumed cooperation with Stanford and Palo Alto agreed to incorporate land
developments into the city. But civic leaders were distressed by some ideas,
such as the large shopping mall that could siphon off revenue from downtown
merchants. The political reality was “Stanford administrators had much more
political clout than Palo Alto elected officials.” (117) (City leaders attempted
to threaten Stanford by cutting off sewer service to oppose the shopping center,
but apparently gave up on the plan – p. 117)</p>

<p>Residential development plans by Stanford began with single-family housing in
Menlo Park, on the northern side of campus near the shopping center. The homes
were designed to appeal to families already in the area, and many new residents
were Stanford alumni. In 1957 Stanford invested more into residential
development with “Stanford Hills,” a subdivision whose houses costs between
$33,000 and $75,000 and whose lot sizes varied from one-quarter-acre up to five
acres. The development was more upscale than other proposed developments in
Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill plans.  The tract was advertised in 1959: “Enjoy
Peninsula Living at its Best . . . in the lovely, rolling ‘Stanford Hills,’ our
largest and most beautiful development. All homes INDIVIDUALLY PLANNED for the
most discriminating buyers. No stock plans . . . no repeats. . . . You, too, can
now join our ‘Who’s Who.’” (quoted, 118)</p>

<p>In 1959, Stanford residential development continued with a development called
Willow Creek Apartments, marketed to mobile, urbane professionals that wanted
the proximity of the University and Shopping Center (or who might otherwise
choose to live in San Francisco). Developer Howard J. White remarked that these
“luxury apartments were the result of innumerable requests on the Peninsula for
true apartment living in a country setting.” (quoted, 118) In all cases,
University residential development was for individuals and families with
a certain income level, far beyond the means of blue-collar workers and out of
reach for most ordinary middle-class residents.</p>

<h3 id="stanford-industrial-development">Stanford Industrial Development</h3>

<p>Stanford Industrial Park was the University’s greatest achievement. The American
campus design tradition of pastoral isolation, separation, and design were
applied to the industrial real estate development in the research park. By 1960
Stanford had been so successful that a newspaper editorial remarked: “The
research centers of the Midpeninsula, with their architectural buildings and
landscaped lawns, look more like college structures than factories. In fact,
I’ve seen many college buildings, and attended classes in a few, that resembled
those factories of old more than do the industrial plants of today.” (quoted,
118)</p>

<p><strong><em>[Thought: I like this quote a lot (“resembled those factories of old more than
do the industrial plants of today”). I think this idea of “clean” or “green”
industry is important to my story, so this is a good anecdote.]</em></strong></p>

<p>p. 118: “The purpose of the Stanford Industrial Park was to strengthen
Stanford’s position as a top national research university through the economic
development of its surrounding region.”</p>

<p>Creating a hub of technology innovation would only be accomplished if Palo Alto
could be persuaded industrial development was a benefit and that development was
attractive to advanced scientific firms and professional employees. Thus,
Stanford administrators set out to make the research park a model of suburban
industrial planning. If the future was high tech industry, as Terman and others
believed, they needed to model how this development could exist with affluent
suburban communities. Research parks that looked different from other industrial
parks could also highlight that scientific industry was different from other
kinds of industrial production: white-collar, clean facilities especially were
key. The only way to make the coexistence of suburban areas and high tech
industry work would be for industrial development to be contained and blend in
with the landscape of the suburban college town. (119)</p>

<p>Administrators designed the Park to placate nervous suburban neighbors,
mirroring the Stanford campus with low-rise and architectually compatible
buildings and open green spaces. They also tied into the belief that scientific
creativity required a pastoral landscape to flourish. Stanford’s ownership of
huge swaths of undeveloped land and the general support of local authorities,
Stanford could translate these pastoral college campus ideas into a new planned
industrial development. (119)</p>

<p>Stanford instituted strict architectural and planning guidelines and maintained
close design control over every facility, including the type, size, location,
and setbacks of buildings, roads, off-street parking and green areas, required
ninety-foot buffers of green space between roads and buildings at the front of
every lot, buildings needed to be low-rise structures, and all structures needed
to include green space. Open land around buildings had to be 60 percent larger
than the buildings constructed, making the park very low density. Companies had
to place parking lots behind buildings rather than towards the street to
maintain the illusion of green space. And all tenants had to gain University
approval for alterations and maintain the cleanliness of their buildings and
grounds. (119-120)</p>

<p>The design of the buildings were modernist and often mimicked the sandstone and
red tile roofs of Stanford. The University also closely controlled the Park’s
tenants. Many of the tenants relied on military contracts, but the Park (and
Stanford) and its services served as a business incubator for high tech
companies. (121-122)</p>

<p>The Industrial Park was smokeless, not dirty, and its workers were white-collar
professionals and portrayed as people with exceptional creative abilities.
Industry was very interested in coming to the Park. Alf Brandin noted to real
estate developers in 1958 that Stanford was “as tough as we could be, and we
couldn’t discourage them.” (quoted, 123) The normal rules of economic
development didn’t apply to the Research Park. Companies attracted to the Park
were drawn by the proximity of defense installations, the natural and community
ammenities, and the concentration of scientific minds.</p>

<p>O’Mara quotes the <em>San Francisco Chroncile</em> article “Brains Are Bait”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Certainly one of the greatest single attractions for the new – and highly
desirable – smogless, light industries that make exostic products is brains.
The electronics and missile industries as well as the less novel, more
familiar varieties, must have a large pool of deep thinkers from which to draw
new ideas, push ahead of competitors in the mad research scramble.” (quoted,
124)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>p. 124: “What the Stanford example demonstrated was the extremely positive
effect of proximity to, and association with, a prominent research institution.”</p>

<p>By 1963, the Research Park was home to forty-two firms employing around twelve
thousand workers. By 1969 the number of tenants jumped to sixty, and the number
of employees to eighteen thousand. Between 1955 and 1968, the Industrial Park
brought in over $13 million in net revenue, becoming Stanford’s most lucrative
land development program. (127)</p>

<p>Observers of the Research Park and other Stanford land development programs
found it to be “a model city” (in the words of a 1955 <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>)
and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> in 1956 noted that the “9,000-acre university
landholdings are fast taking on the appearance of a fully integrated city. When
completed its expected that 45,000 people will live in homes on the land and
thousands will be working at light industry or in business offices and buying at
a shopping center.” (quoted, 127) Stanford became a model example, attracting
interests from other universities seeking to replicate its economic success.</p>

<p>p. 131: “By the mid-1960s the Stanford Industrial Park – a project developed
under extraordinary conditions of university land ownership, massive regional
economic growth, and location in an affluent suburb – had become the gold
standard for science-based industrial development elsewhere in the country and
the world.”</p>

<h3 id="community-stanford-conflict">Community-Stanford Conflict</h3>

<p>Community controversy, however, did follow some of Stanford’s real estate
development plans. Over the course of the 1950s and 1960s residents voiced their
resentment and concerns over Stanford programs. Elected leaders in Palo Alto and
Menlo Park reaped the benefits of new tax revenue and economic visibility, but
by the end of the decade local officials noted a growing discontent among their
constituents. As early as 1953 Palo Alto downtown’s merchants decried the
Stanford Shopping Center, and in 1956 residents of the unincorporated
neighbhorhood Roble Range which bordered the Industrial Park protested to the
Palo Alto city council that the ninety-foot green space buffer was not required
outside the Park and brought the buildings close to their homes. (The city
forced Park tenants to increase this buffer zone, in a rare victory for the city
council.) (132-133)</p>

<p>One councilman complained that the University was “‘negligent’ in its treatment
of the public, and was ‘selfishly developing its property from a dollars and
cents angle.’” (quoted 133)</p>

<p>Stanford’s community relations approach didn’t help. Stanford leaders strongly
felt that Palo Alto existed only because of Stanford’s benefits, and thought
little of the city other than a college town whose economic and cultural center
was at the University. This caused Stanford to be heavy-handed in its dealing
with neighbors.</p>

<p>Community concerns were expressed during early plans for the Research Park. At
a meeting with the community, Alf Brandin noted “it was evident that certain
factions in attendance were attempting to put in the minds of those present the
fact that industrial property, as such, holds little or no advantage for the
City of Palo Alto. . . . I took the opportunity of presenting the point of view
that industrial property, as we are planning and developing, has a great many
more advantages to the City of Palo Alto than otherwise.” (quoted, 133) The
University and local allies in city goverment attempted to assure Palo Alto
residents that the Park would not bring the “noxious” by-products of air and
noise pollution associated with the industrial park. Brandin later noted: “when
it came to the industrial park, our problem was semantics. What were we
producing out there? We tried to say it has got to be clean, no smoke, no heavy
manufacturing. Light manufacturing that is clean and electronic.” (quoted, 133)</p>

<p><strong><em>[The above paragraph is also key to my argument – these ideas about clean
industry should form a core part of this.]</em></strong></p>

<p>In 1962, Palo Alto residents petitioned President Sterling with complains about
Varian Associates facility:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]hey use machines that make a high pitched whine. All last week we were
awakened mornings – usually around 5:30. . . . And the noise and fumes from
their stack continues unabated 24 hours a day. On certain days the acid odor
is very strong and the acid fumes has [sic] damaged many of our trees and
shrubs, our cars and much of our patio furniture. When we contact Varian
directly we usually have a few days respite – then it all starts again.
(quoted, 134)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stanford attempted to stem concerns among residents and used its power as
landlord to negate disturbances. When Hewlett-Packard’s nighttime lights created
community relations problems, Stanford wrote that it “strongly recommend
corrective measures be taken promptly to remedy this situation, particularly in
view of the proposed Hewlett-Packard expansion in Industrial Park.” (quoted,
134)</p>

<p>A more disturbing form of pollution, one Stanford couldn’t control, was
radiation. One resident who lived near Lockheed Martin wrote the <em>Palo Alto
Times</em> in 1960 that “it is disconcerting . . . to have a federal agent pick
leaves from our shrubs once a month, to test them for radioactivity.” (quoted,
134) The landscaping and architecture of the Park could not disguise the
pollution created by the tenants. (134-135)</p>

<h3 id="battle-of-the-hills">Battle of the Hills</h3>

<p>Fears among Palo Alto residents came to a head in 1960, when University
proposals to extend the Industrial Park toward the foothills near Stanford’s
property was fiercely opposed by neighborhoods. This led to a referendum
campaign that President Sterling called “the Battle of the Hills.”</p>

<p>Editorials poured in to the <em>Palo Alto Times</em> and Sterling receied around 400
letters of opposition and fifty of support. One telegram to Sterling summed up
the general attitude of opposition: “Offocial request to annex Stanford foothill
land to Palo Alto in advance of scheduled Board of Trustees meeting today
shocking. Complete disregard to objective alumni and community public opinion
evident. Irresponsible attitude clearly shown. Apparent moral deterioration and
decay and abandonment of high Stanford University standards and principles is
sickening.” (quoted, 135)</p>

<p><strong><em>[O’Mara notes that the Battle of the Hills was fueled by nostalgia and
environmentalism, but I don’t see much environmentalism coming through in her
examples. I need to look at her evidence and see if that is indeed the case. The
Battle of the Hills might be a good case study in environmental movements.]</em></strong></p>

<p>Stanford often behaved arrogantly in the Battle of the Hills, pretending to
understand community concerns publicly but privately disregarding public
opinion. Donald Carlson, an associate of Sterling’s, responded to an alumna who
wrote an angry note accusing Stanford of selfishness, replied dryly: “I am so
impressed by your knowledge of the University and its land problems that I feel
compelled to address you a personal acknowledgement. The consideration, logic,
and unselfish interest you have demonstrated surely must have given inspiration
to the Trustees.” (quoted, 136)</p>

<p>Stanford believed it had the public interest in mind with the expansion of the
Industrial Park. The existing park had already intorduced tax benefits and
enabled the University to raise its profile. But one resident responded:
“[T]here has been growing concern over Stanford’s policy of presenting
pre-packaged zoning requests. . . . They resemble closely the tactics of many
a Land Developer asking for variances from planned uses.” (quoted, 136)</p>

<p>Sterling challenged these accusations, arguing that “Stanford has made
a conscientious effort to keep the communities surrounding the campus informed
of our plans, an effort which could easily be documented.” (quoted, 136)</p>

<p>The planned expansion became a referendum on the November 1960 ballot. A “yes”
vote would allow the expansion to go as planned. Some of Stanford’s own allies,
however, opposed the measure. Dorothy Varian, wife of Industrial park tenant
Russell Varian, wrote the <em>Palo Alto Times</em> urging a “no” vote. (136-137)</p>

<p>But over the course of the year Stanford managed to gain support from alumni and
members of the community. As the election neard, the <em>Times</em> spoke in favor of
the development, reminding residents of the debt they owed Stanford for keeping
the lands open: “Stanford’s 9,000 acres having constituted a free park for the
people of Palo Alto and surrounding communities. If these broad acres had been
owned by other private interests, they long ago would have been converted to the
houses, business places and industries where so many of us live and work –
including those who oppose Stanford’s industrial expansion.” (quoted, 137)</p>

<p>In the end, Stanford won the Battle of the Hills. The referendum passed easily
in November, but the actions of the community had an impact. The University was
more aware of community opposition, and signaled a changing power dynamic in
Palo Alto. No longer could planning processes occurr behind closed doors. Plans
had to win the approval of grassroots community groups, and Stanford needed to
mobilize its support among the Peninsula. Stanford also scaled back building
plans and hoped to diffuse concerns by giving the Park the new name “Stanford
Research Park.” (An administrative memorandum in 1961 noted: “The term
‘Industrial Park’ serves as a real red flag.” O’Mara, quoted 137).</p>

<p>Stanford’s lessons served it a year later, when in 1961 Palo Alto officlas
considered the expansion of Oregon Avenue, a main road running through some of
the town’s most desirable residential land, into an expressway intended to
accomodate industrial traffic to and from the Research Park. Residents opposed
the plan and mobilized opposition, but no sooner had they done so when
a community group calling themselves the Traffic Action Committee rose up to
support the measure. The pro-expressway movement may have had grassroots
support, but the TAC was not. Stanford development chief Alf Brandlin had a hand
in creating the group, according to Donald Carlson. Carlson noted that “there is
more politicking here than meets even my jaundiced eye,” but he noted the
intervention might be good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of our Industrial Park and all of the emotion the just-off Oregon
Avenuers have stirred up about it, Stanford is a nasty word down in that area.
We are not giong to suddenly turn on any lights, show the truth and make them
love us. So I don’t see much harm in our taking a background role in the
Traffic Action Committee. It could improve our relations with the Menlo people
because the peripheral plan proposes to put a heck of a lot more truck traffic
on proposed Willow Freeway. . . . there are at least a half dozen councilmen
(including the mayor) who are anxious to get the thing turned around somehow
and get some of that bond money applied to the city’s traffic problem where it
hurts the most. So they are looking for public support. (quoted, 138)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The strategy worked; the community opponents to the Oregon Expressway won some
points – managing to downsize the original plans and direct the route to less
disruptive residential areas – university officials got the traffic artery the
Park needed.</p>

<p>The controversies over the Oregon Expressway and expansion of the Research Park
reflected “an early and important instance of resident activism against
uncontrolled suburban growth.” (138) By 1960 residents felt surrounded by
freeways, subdivisions, office buildings, and shopping centers. Concern about
the “slurban” landscape resulting from rapid and decentralized urban growth. The
political movement against excesses and environmental degredation from postwar
suburbanization gained steam in the 1960s and 1970s and spurred open-space and
preservation and growth-control efforts in the region. The Bay Area, in effect,
became “home to some of the environmental movement’s most important early
battles and precedent-setting land-use planning measures.” (139)</p>

<p>The Battle of the Hills was led by the sort of educated professionals the
developments were designed to attract. (139)</p>
