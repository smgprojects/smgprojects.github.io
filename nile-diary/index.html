<h2 id="editors-note">Editor’s note</h2>

<p>I am interested in this diary because - eventually - the author spends time in Rome and Pompeii. I am also interested to see what her impression is of the Nile, its antiquities and its people. From a methodological point of view, I am also transcribing this diary to learn how to use <a href="https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/">Transcribus</a>, an environment that uses machine learning to -eventually- learn how to OCR the handwriting. Some of its (Transkribus’) features include automatic line detection, which is great for moving through the transcription methodically. Transkribus will also export the transcription as TEI, or as text embedded in the pdf, or as a Word doc. It doesn’t do markdown. It also doesn’t seem to export a space at the end of a line of text, and so you get words mushed where there should be line breaks. Finally, I was also interested in pushing this through <a href="https://github.com/elotroalex/ed">‘Ed’</a>, but I kept getting weird kramdown errors and I figured, bah, just put it in my notebook. As always, <a href="http://hypothes.is">Hypothes.is</a> is enabled to allow me to mark up and link outwards to other kinds of information. Yes, I could do that in the text too, but I like the Hypothesis api.</p>

<h2 id="august-1874">August 1874</h2>

<p><strong>Aug. 22 - 1874</strong>. Left New York in Cunard steamer Algeria David, George, Bruce, D. W. Bishop and Ella Barrett with Augusta (the laundress) to see us off - a rainy day. D. W. Bishop introduced us toMr. Brown of Yorkshire, and to Mr. Smith, a Presb. clergyman of Lenox whowith his family was going to his native Scotland. Capt. read serviceon Sunday morning - in afternoon dead body of whale white, andshiny quite near us upon the water and hundreds of little birds uponit. The first half of voyage had smooth sea, mild temperature,and head winds. Saw a number of vessels. The second sundaymorning found the sea running high (it had been quite roughfor a couple of days) suddenly a great wave rose ten feetabove the deck and came down upon it knocking downevery one before it, C. among the number and came downthe gangway and into all the deck staterooms to the depthof five or six inches, setting all moveable things, trunks, etcafloat. I sat up on my couch and held on to my trunk and to C’schair that they might not go out and obstruct the passage ways.This was shortly before 10. A.M. After a time C. waded downto me with her shoes in her hand to report herself all soundbut drenched. Lunch was served at noon, and soon afterthe stewards had succeed in getting the water out of the
room sufficiently for C. to change her dress and for us tolook into my trunk. Everything below the trays had to bewrung out and hung up! On Sunday night a woman in the steerage died of heart defects. The wave was not the causethey were not at all wet there. The following night she wasburied at sea, the Capt. and Dr. being present. Tuesday at 2 P.M. landed passengers at Queenstown, having goneup into the harbor farther than I had ever been before.</p>

<h2 id="september-1874">September 1874</h2>

<p><strong>Sept 2</strong> - Wednesay at 8 A.M. stopped at the bar of the Merseyfor four hours for the tide. Finally stopped about 2 P.Mcustoms house officers and mr. Sherlock came on board.We were at the Adelphi where Mr. Sherlock had engagedrooms for us at 3 1/2 P.M. Among our passengers we hadbecome more particularly acquainted with there with us atthe Captain’s talbe Mrs. Larisson and daughter of Baltimore and her niece Miss Patterson, (great nice of Mr Mrs Bonapart)Mr. Yarnall of Philadelphia, going out to meet his wife and children in England - Mr. Jaqueneot a silk merchant 25 years old, native of Genoa, but living 6 years or morein Japan full of life and lafter - a Scotch lawyer opposite -Mr. Middleton, half Italian, half English, a most refined and cultivated young gentleman. He was baptized by PopeGregory 16, has an uncle a cardinal, and a great grand father’s headwas hung under London Bridge for being a Jacobite. Therewas also a Mr. and Mrs. Macklin, a most devoted couple who had a room opposite ours. After dinner walked to Brown’s Librarybut had not long to remain, the Egyptian collection lookedinteresting. Stepped into the great Northern Hotel - bough thei…critable piece of camphor. I did not have any letters towrite as I had written to all the family from Queenstown.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 3</strong> Thursday. Had been most comfortable at the Adelphi.Left room after 9 a.m. in the London and North Western. The countrylooked brown and autumnal. At E. Sq. Station saw six cor….s chained together Reached Euston Sq. station 2.30 P.M.Are at Bracon’s Hoetel, 21 Dover st. Piccadilly. A rainy afternoonvery tired, did not go out.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 4</strong> Friday. A rainy day went about noon to theKensington Museum. Met directly Miss Carter of Ireland,one of our fellow passengers who showed us the drawings ofthe students, one of her own among them very prettilycoloured, a fruit piece. A course of frut is gone through beforethey are allowed to go to the human figure. Took our lunch in the grill room. The wall in …. representing the month and seasons, stained glass window of Fox and Grafer. At oneend is a great range with a very large gridiron, and the steakor chop the only things furnished there are cooked before youreyes and serve quite hot and nice. Opening out of this is theDining room where cut from the joint etc are served. We went through the picture gallery, Resa…. galleries, and the Loancoolection which is very beautiful particularly in enamels.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 5</strong> Saturday. Walked over to Regents Quadrant, and downRegent at 20 Carleton Terrace. C. spoke to one of the men whohave fruit stalls behind the terrace at the end of St James Park - hisgreat grand father had had the stall originally. He had a cowthere too so as to sell fresh milk. Bought guide books for Egyptat Stanfords and …. map of London at Smiths. Lunched atCharing Cross Station, noisy and confused. Strolled to the VictoriaEmbankment and sat down in garden by Charing Cross Bridge. Herestill stands the old water gate of York House. Visited NationalGallery - notice the Turners, and took cab home. Found ourtrunks by the goods train had arrived.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 6.</strong> Sunday All Saints Margaret st. reachedthere late, a fi… seat, ch.. absent on holliday - wretched sermon. Church beautiful. A cold rainy day, did not go out again.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 7</strong> - Monday - Next to St Pauls - entered by door at endwhich is much more impressive than side entrace. A chapel on theleft hand is filled up much in Roman Catholic style. Thework of decorating dome etc progresses very slowly. Brassmural tablets have been erected to the memory of the officers andmen who perished by the capsizing of the Captain off CapeFinisterre in 1870. The tonnage or construction of the vessel had beenchanged while building and the Captian had not be modified. This isperperly set forth in the memorial. Took lunch and spent the restof the day in Bethnell Green Museum and wonderfully beautifulcollection of pictures etc. On leaving I went a little way into VictoriaPark - returning xxxxx Lunatic Asylum, Holborn Valley Viaduct, NewMetropolitan Market with its handsome iron gates and street runningunder it. Somewhere a house with slab inserted to show that Drydenlived there.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 8</strong> - Tuesday. Went to Dr. Reynolds - every thing very tastefuldrawings, fern cakes, Scotch grey xxxxx. He had nothing different tosay except to approve of our sojurn in Egypt. Mrs. O’Sullivanand Mrs. Landen out of town, left cards. Went to the Grill roomfor lunch, went into the International Gallery - pictures modern and quite interesting - the garden fine - heard organ in AlbertHall and crossed Hyde Park to see Albert memorial veryfine and grand. In the evening had a very pleasant visitfrom Mr. Middleton who brought a beautiful collection ofgold coins to show us. He took C’s watch to be repaired.</p>

<p><strong>Sept 9</strong> - Wednesday. Went out a pouring rain and boughtsome fruit for lunch. Mr. M. came for lunch at 12.30 and then wewent out in brougham to Westminster Abbey. He got the key,of some places there not generally shown to the public. Wewent up a narrow winding room stone stairs behindthe chapel of Edward the Confessor into an upper roomwhere prayers were said for the soul of Henry 5th hishelmet, shiled, and saddle of the armour that her wore atAgincourt were on a beam above, they probablywould not bear handling. He showed us someother places of this sort used for praying for somedeparted one in particular. He opened another littledoor a wooden stairs to the same sort of little roomwhere were effigies of distinguished persons dressed in the clothes they had worn in life- these very effigieswere carried in the funeral procession. There were Charles 2nd in beautiful lace and velvet, Queen Elizabeth frightfully ugly,Lord Nelson. The Duke of Buckingham (George Villiers) wasrepresented as lying dead, all the others as standing and alive. Agreat quantity of mock jewelry decorated them all, but they wore their own clothes and superb real lace. In a closet were the mannikinswith out any faces or dresses. Saw the wooden box containing thebones of Major Andre. In a side chapel on one side is a recent bustof the late F. D. Maurice where it seems strangely out of place. Noticedthe very beautiful iron work enclosing the tombe of Henry 7. Went intohist beautiful chapel, superb roof, banners of the knights of the order ofthe Bath, no banners are added but a new brass plate is put infor each new knight. No one is allowed to go upon the roofthe ceiling is considered so insecure. We went into theChapter House a very beautiful octagonal room with largelofty windows a high roo with one beatuiful marble columb in the centre - the original fine tile floor. Theyhave it practically covered with matting to preserve it. In thechapel of Ed. the Confessor near the entrance Mr. M. drew a boltin the floor and showed us a bit about 10 in by 5 of the original mosaicpavement. In the cloisters some composition has been putover the roof and carvings to preserve them as they were allcrumbling away. He pointed out some of the new purchased at the National Gallery - fine old pictures and wonderful prices.One by                 is so much retouched that they talk of having it cleaned to come down to the original He broughtus a guide book to London a hundred years ago to look at.Among the coins he brought was one of silver of Queen Elizabethmade so old and ugly that she ordered them all destoryed, abouta third of this has been cut off, but the head it left entire. Thisis the only one know to exist. The British Museum offered him [pounds] 60 for it which he declined but has left it to the Museum in his will. After he left us I bought this book etc. Miss Carymade us a very agreeable visit in the evening. She toldus that it has been quite the fashion this summer to makeexcursions in the environs in certain six horse coaches, whichare often driven by the owners, gentlemen, sometimes peersof the realm. They start from the White Horse cellars also by</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 10</strong> - Thursday. To Northumberland House,Trafalgar Square which is entirely dismantled, every thingmoveable gone even to the mantels and the timbers, stone, doorwindows stair cases etc are being sold at auction. TheBallroom and Pompeian room must have been superb.The kitchen, offices, pantries, and the arrangements for the servants are on a very extensive scale. The building is palatial, and when the garden ran down to the Thames itmust have been superb. Drove to the Victoria Station, luncheon,and went by train 1/2 hr to Dulwich, where a ten minutes walkbrought us to the gallery - free - the Murillo’s and Cuyp’s areparticularly fine. The Murillo’s Madonna of the Rosary is here,his Flower Girl and Peasant Boys. Rembrandt’s Little ServingMaid looking out of a window is very attractive. Other finepcitures by other artists. Had to wait a while for the train.Sydenham is but a very little farther.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 11</strong> - Friday. Mr. M. lunched with us again. We wentin the brougham to the Foreign Office, a superbe new building - built around four side of a large quadrangle, on this interiorcourt statues and bust ornament the walls of the building. Thestaircase is magnificent entirely of mrables of the countrywhe wh of the balustrade is of dove colored marble perhaps 10 inwide, side walls painted on the plaster in excellent lathcoloring fine. The room for the reception of ambassadors iselegant, but they have retained the old fireplace which istoo insignificant for this fine room. The dining roomadjoining is spacious and elegant here they have retained the old mahogany furniture which is not much xxxx. Passedinto the India Office which was built before this and is notnearly so fine. Saw some carved slabs from India undera glass roof. At the British Museum saw some of thecoins and intaglios some of the latter very fine and costly. Inthe same room is the Etruscan jewelry bought fromCastellani for which together with the bronzes the Museumgave [pounds]20 000. Among these bronzes is a life size headof Minirva very beautiful, the back of the head filled inwith wood- a little figure about 8 in. high which haddiamond eyes - could not get near this as the room wasbeing cleaned. mr. M. by some magic took us intothe room where are the manuscripts and wrote an order fortwo which were brought, also a sack to put them onthey had belonged to the Dukes of Norfolk and were bequeathedby one of them to the Museum the first was of the 13th centurythe last a volume of a Bible was of the 14th, very finelyexecuted, a miniature of about 3 1/2 in by 4 1/2 on almostevery leaf the back rounds of these were of a very richdiaper patterns often showing the Dukes arms as ifwas painted for Lxxx of course they were on vellum. There can be very few manuscripts as fine as this. For oneof the cases outside is a part of the Magna Charta, which someone rescued from a sailor just as he was going to cut it intopatterns. Next into the reading room an immense circularroom lighted from the top with every convenience- books ofreference line the walls all around - the real library isshut off in numerous small room and every quarter hour atruck of books is wheeled in that has been ordered the previousquarter. Mr. M. told us that the sale of the NorthumberlandHouse brought only [pounds] 5000, the government gave [pounds] 100,000 for thehouse and I think [pounds] 156,000 more for the grounds. The Governmentcompelled the Duke to sell it as it is planned to run a finestreet through there. After parting with Mr. M. we went to theDeré gallery where we found Mr. and Mrs. Pjee Ronalds en routefor home; but as Mr. R is not well at present it is probable thatthey will remain this side. They told us of the death of Mr. Ad. Thomas.Passed the evening very agreeably in the Cary’s parlor, MrsLeRoy was there.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 12</strong> - Saturday. Called at St. George’s Albemarle st. to seeif Mrs. L. Spencer might be there - walked up New Bond st. stoppedinto Phillip’s China shop. For Solon’s cameo’s about 10 in by 5 in he asked from       to 35 figureines. There is only one of eachsubject no duplicates of his work and he is employed by N….In this respect his work is like pictures. A tea set bought by a N. S. lady was 55 guineas - it consists of 18 cups and saucer 2 cakeplates and a slp bowl. Tiffany has some single cups of it jolanderpattern rich brown and gold grass and birds on white ground linedwith pink. The Artistic Grey stone ware is made in Londonand called Doulton Pottery. Looked for books about Egypt.Went to our bankers and to enquire for Alston, then to theBethnall Green Museum, looked principally at the FrenchSchool of paintings which is very fine rich in Meissoniers,Vernels, Decamps, Greuze etc. Some very few Raynolds,and Lawrence’s. Dined at the Criterion - a very fine buildingelegant staircase - tiles on each side with fine effect.Had walked through the Metropolitan meat market.</p>

<p><strong>Sept 13</strong> Sunday - Went to St Andrews, nells St. ritualistic - choir away, service not very satisfactory, sermon poor.Corssed over to All Saints where we saw the end of the Communnion service. The Officiating Priests were dressed in a sortof pale brown robes trimmed with red. He who carried thechalice seemed to wave it in the form of a cross before presenting it to each person - when we first entered we saw afew men go to the altar and when they had commensied file off ontheir side, when they had finished a few more women ear - thecheri was fine - the service seemed impressive. The church verytasteful and rich in its decorations, beautiful marbles, some tileand bricks of various colrs are introduced with good effect. Therestaurants being closed wwe lunched at home and walkedto Westminster Abbey and though we arrived there 15 minutesbefore the hour specified every seat where one could hope to hearwith comfort was filled. Made several ineffectual attempts andlooked around during most of the service - stood and heard a fewwords towards the end of the sermon. Saw Mr. Lewis Rutherford there.After walking around the equestrian statue of Richard Couer de Liontook a hanson and drove through Pimlico, through Victoria street and other streets of new andcomfortable houses, belonging very largely to the Marquis of Westministerthere over the scarcely finished Chelsea suspension bridge (had topayd 2d. toll each way) to Battersea Park - a park for the people andthey seemed to be enjoying it this fine afternoon. Some finetrees, and flower beds stiffly laid out; but tended with care and verypretty and tasteful altogeether very attractive, two or three houses of refreshment. Returningcame through Chelsea street where are Bassicks which must be a
fifth of a mile in length and some way up through Strand st toPiccadilly. From Battersea Park had noticed the Hospital, and a Cedar of Lebanon which Murray says is in Physic Gardens there.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 14</strong> - Monday. Again to Westminster Abbey where wepoke about for a long time looking more particularly at theinteresting things that Mr. M. had shown us, at the Champslevé enamel which were were not accquainted with before.The Chapter House is very interesting. Near the entranceis the wooden door leading to where the Pyx was keptSome one who had tried to rob it was flayed and his skinnailed upon the door. Mr. M. remembered seeing somebit of it there, and put his hand over the top said he couldfeel some of it still. Lunched at the Criterion and came home.C. Went to bed with a headache. In the evening Mrs.L. Spencer and Charlie called also Mr. M., he broughtC’s watch and some photographs for us to look at.</p>

<p><strong>Sept 15</strong> - Tuesday - Commenced our preparations forleaving by buying a number of Murray’s Guides etc.At Goodis 19 South Audley st saw fine plates for Duke ofEdinburg 15 Guineas each, some things were cheaper thanat Kensington Museums. The display was very beautiful. Lunch in South Kensington Museum. Noticed the ornamentsof pure gold brought from Ashantee, also slate swords etc etc. Noticedenamels which can be well studied here, think our little box”Tho absent not forgot” is Battersea Enamel - saw more champlieeenamel near by were the cloisonné a Limoges enamels. Upstairs in the jewel case is an enormous pearl 2 inches ormore long and about 1 in thick it is shaded, there are manyother interesting stones. Noticed the Henri II vase calledinlaid earthenware - very much valued. Found a courier waiting to see us when we returned. He spokeall languages, and had been every where, and all this for [pounds] 15 a month.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 16</strong> - Wednesday - Walked around Berkeley Sq., where isGunter’s Fashionalbe place for rich and in afternoons during the seasonscarriages may be seen in front of this shop with ladies insideenjoying the ices. Earl of Haddinton and some others live here,houses quite plain, but of extra width. Left my water in M….st., and strolled around Grosvenor Sq. where the houses are very muchfiner - that of the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres especially fine - theseof the Earl of Percy and of the Earl of Shaftesbury are quite out ofrepair, Bought some drugs etc, and went to the British MuseumLooked amost opposite in a side st. Looked principally at the

<p><strong>Sept. 19</strong> Saturday Packed a trunk to go to Paris by Petit VitesseAgain did not go out unitl about 2 P.M. bought an albumwent into Soho Bazaar, which seemed to be a collection of small shops forselling often useless artists. They finished paering our street today.It seems to have been macadmised - they dug up the old stones andperhaps added some new, scattered fresh earth and watered it and rolledit down by means of a steam engine with the tires of each of the twowheeles about a foot wide and behind a roller of about thrice the widthwhich would have just fitted  xxxx them. The job is not very good.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 20</strong> - Sunday. Went for 10 a.m. service to Westminister Abbey.Canon Kingsley did not preach after; but read the commandmentand gospel very badly. The congregation did not assemble until nearthe hour. Drove to see the church of st.

Packed trunks and went in cab to change onepair of colored glasses which had been given to us a wrong xxx butit being the day of atonement Solomon’s place was closed andwas taken to one of his wokers who elonged it but the wholeaffair cost twice as much as a new pair would have done.At charing cross Station our luggage weighed heavy, couldnot allow us on both parcels - paid in full on that to BoulogneThe train passage through quite a pretty country to Folkstone.(via Tunbridge) Had left London at 1.25 - left Folkstone xxxxdiaxxx on arrival of train 3.50 and reached Boulogne about 5. P.M. therehaving been considerable wind and some sprinkling of rain many were
sea-sick. I did not disgrace myself. There were four or five French fishermenand a little boy on board who has been run down at sea in their boat.He excited a good deal of sympathy particularly one man who was injured -the father of the boy. It was curious to see the women hauling the trunks -they looked old; but were very brisk. In short dark woollen dresses withwet worsted stockings and wooden shoes, carefully flushed white caps and long mas-sive looking gold earings. She looked very clean, and quite happy. We were sometime detained at the Douane. After dinner wlked a few steps eachway in the street, and saw “la retraite”, that is the guarde Eugenie who areabout returning to their home after a short visit in Boulogne.

Drove about for an hour up to the old town which is still surrounded by a high wall, enteredunder of its old gateways. The belfrey of the Palais de justicedates back to the 13th century and is quite grass grown. The cathedral isquite a fine building - has a tall dome - the paintings xxx aremostly black and white.

Went into the church opposite because we saw a carpetdown. Though the church was handsome and the people looked nice,the ceremony seemed tedious. The couple had a good time torest seated in their comfortable own chairs. When the ceremonywas nearly over a young lady who was seated directly behindthe bride rose and taking a bag in her hand was handed downthe aisle by a gentlmean, She handing a sort of box or bag intowhich almost everyone put a small coin, the berger preceeded herand announced that it was “pour les pauvres”.

Orange andlemon trees, all in the hotel garden before our windows and beyondthe sea, of which we hear the roll distinctly. Took a superbdrive, and the “grand tour de la Californie pas le caual”charming views, Esterel rocks jutting out proudly with thesea towards the west. In front Ile St. Margueritefrom which Marshal Bazaine recently escaped. Villa dottedall over the landscape. Vegetation charming quite differentfrom any thing to which I am accustomed. The fragrantyellow cassia in bloom from which they make scent. Theblue green eucalyptus tree a pleasing variety and many othernovelties. Returning stopped at Villa San Jean, belongingto the Comtesse de Chaponay, very beautiful did not gointo the house though the old servant who knew of Cath urged us to do so. Drove in the opposite direction to seewhere Lord Brougham had lived. Walked in the afternoon.Old town very narrow and dirty. Went into market just asthey were removing the booths. Peaches, chestnuts, pearsgrapes, tomatoes beans etc. There is a factory of pottery herefine shapes, coarse ware, attempts at Etruscan, cheap.Saw men driving piles. Twelve men pulled ropes tolift - a heavy arrangement of iron and stone and then let itfall upon the pile. Dreadful labor. Charming re….Two months away from home today.</p>

<p><strong>Oct. 23</strong> Friday Left Cannes towards noon and should havebeen at Nice in an hour. Train about a half hour behindtime and there a long detention in leaving station at Nice.Hotel de France, considered best cuisine in Nice, ….rooms, lovely southern exposure. Walked about promenadesAnglais, bridges over the Piglione, looked in at the Chauvain</p>

<p><strong>Oct. 24</strong> Saturday No letters. C. took me up stairs at thechauvain and showed me the room occupied four years ago etc.Soon after noon went by rail three quarters of an hour toMonaco, in omnibus up the hill to the palace. Built arounda hollow square, the arcades of which have tawdry frescoes of century, some represent the labours of Hercules from whomMonaco is said to date. A fine marble st… going up both ways.The appartments tasteful, the floors marble f the ordinary peacheycolor coarse mosaics so much used in Italy, poor portrait offamily conections, some reigning in Austria, Bavaria et. Finebedroom where the Duke of York, brother to George the third died. Theview from the windows much interesting. The garden is ….-ing t….d on the slope of the hill, carefully laid out next thetropical vegetation to which we are becoming quite accustomed. A ten minute drive or less to Monte Carlo. We enteredthe casino, directly opposite the entrance a fince concertwas going on in a large hall. The audience only abouttwenty five patrons. Towards our right was a beautifulreading room in a rather Pompeian style of decoration - abundantly supplied with papers. Turning back to the leftcrossing a richly decorated room where no one was sitting toone still riches  in something of a Moorish style when werethe gambling tables - about sixty persons were sitting atthem playing of whom ten were women. There might havebeen thirty or more looking on. Outside are gardens beautifullylaid out and an excellent hotel, also a restuarant. Were back at Nice by 5.30. The shop keepers do not find enough visitors yet for them to open their shop. Many have the shutters still closed.</p>

<p><strong>Oct. 25</strong> - Sunday. Drove to C….s Arrived there the roadruns directly through the remains of a Roman amphitheatrecontinued to the church built on the site of a temple of DianaPeeked into the cloisters of Franciscan convent adjoining. Wentinto cemetery. For the centre was a fine monument to anEnglish lady. In front of the church are several magnificienttrees “chenes Virls” Several hundred years old. Returned byway of Carabacel( a part of Nice further removed from the sea)There seemed to be a great many villas, some of them veryfine.Drove the whole length of promenade anglais,very pretty, it took about 8 minutes. Saw G. Crosby andwife in front of his house there. Drove over bridge to the oldtown and got out and walked about some of the narrowstreets and market places. Stepped into a house that lookedfiner than the rest, it had belonged to a noble family butno to some one else and seemed used in part as ersatz tenementhouse. After lunch went to the English church buthad made a mistake in the hour of service. The churchis very pretty and neat stained glass windows, font nearthe door. The grave yard between the church and the street. In the afternoon went over to the park to hear the music, partlywith the hope of seeing M. Thiers who had just arrived. droveto the old chateau, charming view, Nice laying below, and thedry bed of the torrent distinctly dividing the old and new townsa amphitheatre of hills surrounding it except where the Mediterranean stretched. Many villas on the hill sides. In frontof our hotel, the date palm and Eucalyptus alternate. It is onlyabout ten years since the first Eycalyptus were planted hereand they are large trees. They seem to have leaves of twodistincally different shapes or perhaps they change in shapeas the tree grows older. It only grows between Marsailles and Genoa. The bark is smooth but peels offeven quite cut on the branches giving it a ragged appearance.The pepper trees here are very pretty with their fine foliage andbright peppers hanging down. Nor quite …. which began of Cannes still contains. Waiters and some of the visitors look as if in early shapes of small pox</p>

<p><strong>Oct. 26</strong> Monday - Vetterino and four horses at 8 1/2 a.m. - crossedthe Pallion and directly the road began to ascend, fine viewsover Nice and and its hills, seemed to follow the Pallion which isbanked up for many miles and perfectly dry up here. theMediterranean and its coast seam spread as a map below us - counted fifty sails in sight at once. This coast is full ofcharming bays. Our departure by vetturino seemed to createsome excitement among the passers by at Nice. Before we were fairly out of the city our leaders turned right roundto look in the carriage window they had not been usedin this way before; but afterwards went well ; we keptthem about two hours. Up on our left we could see thesnowy points of the Col de Lende (of the Maritime Alps) andthe distant hills looked bleak, though those near wecould see were often terraced to the top and planted withthe vine, the fig and olive. We looked down of Ville F…with its beautiful bay where our squadron winteredfour years ago, then came the long projectiongpeninuslar of Ospizio with its lighthouse. Soon welooked down on the high isolated hill of Ese with its ruinof what must have been a fedual castle, and houses allabout on the ride towards the sea. A real robberstronghold. Had a grand view of Monaco, and MonteCarlo. Passed through the village of Roccabruna, builton (Murray says) Eocene breccia, great masses of which arestanding in among the houses. A very romantic place. Before coming to Roccabruna saw that deeply indented whiteleaf now so fashionable in N. Y. growing on the side of therock, all the same color. Saw jig trees as large as large appletrees and very fine old olive trees. Reached Murtana about12 1/2 P.M. Lunched at Hotel Victoria seemed a good hotel and thetown seemed quite flourishing. We left before two and sooncame to the French frontier where our veterino’s papers we examined and some formality (a pass or something given).Corssed Pont St. Louis which is the boundary between Franceand Italy and on top of the hill encountered the Italian customs housewho took Josephine’s word and only examined her handbag! At Ventimiglia (the first Italian town) we passed right through afort for some distance, indeed all about here had the appearance of being strongly fortified. The town itslef looked very romanticand curious as we looked back at it from the bridge. Going through it it was curious to look in the … shops and narrowstreets.  At Bordigliera the date palm is cultivated for the church, and we saw so many we felt quite satiated. Manyof them were tied up to keep their centres white for Palm Sunday. Some seemed to leaf out directly from the groundto grow quite wild. Some were only bare stalks the leaves having all been cut from the top. Arrived at San Remo Hotel Bellerice soon after 5 P.M. Charming situation, excellentclean hotel. While taking our dinner we enquired about the tabled’hote and found that the two gentlement dining at a neighboringround table, like our own, composed the whole table d’hote.One of them is a young English clergyman, perhaps the onesttled here. Three days ago we and one gentleman composed thetable d’hote at Nice. Today had shown us a successionof beautiful pictures and the weather has been perfect.</p>

<p><strong>Oct. 27</strong> Tuesday - Not being aware of our change from Paris to Roman time we kept our vetterino waiting a long half hourdid not start until 9 a.m. A gentleman in the breakfast roomwho with his wife had just come from Rome and Naples sayshe did not find it at all too warm. On our way out of SanRemo passed a number of hotel evidently fitted up for theEnglish. Our road lay along the coast, on our right laya great expanse of sea with not enough land to make itpicturesque and on our right the hills had been out away fromthe road so that they were no longer beautiful, crossedthe railroad track repeatedly. At San Stefano saw agreat many nets drying and a vessel being repaired. At Porte Maurizio were many vessels drawn upon the sand. AtOriglia crossed a fine suspension bridge and stopped 2 hours at the innto rest the horses and lunch. Walked with Josephine, bought somegrapes and peaches and a little sacuer of polenta which we tasted in thestreet. There seemed to be no regular market place, but womeneverywhere selling fruit and veg. A great deal of Italian paste for sale.This morning saw a woman with a great square green cake on herhead for sale. It was dried green pease made into this form, a lot of puree.Part of the time were shut in by olive trees. After Capo delle Mole thevegetation looks more home like - the birch and horsechestnut appearand the cypress and agave have almost disappeared. Crossed once clearstream of running water, where there was no bridge nor embankment, forded the shallow stream. Very pretty views now manytowns on surrounding hills, reached Alassio about 4. P.M. Hotel de Londrespainted gayly outside, the back of it is upon the sandy beach whereis quite a good surf and great noise. From our terrace saw a steamer passing. C. andI took a walk, saw orange tree large and great apple trees and full of  fruit. Wnet up on a sort of paved donkey road on a terassedhill side, might have gone to the summit but it was toofatiguing. The man wanted to give us somee white arte…This seems to have been a walled town. From our terrace saw the moon rise beautifully over the hills and reflect on the water.</p>

<p><strong>Oct. 28</strong> Wednesday. The sun rose beautifully out of the water soonafter 6 1/2 A.m. We …. breakfast, made up for it by figs in the carriage.Started at 9. The whole road has been much more interesting thanyesterday. Especially the last half, blod rocks rising to a very greatheight, somethree times passed through tunnels, sometimes throughdeep cuttings in the rock, and sometimes was blasting out out …perpendicular side. A very fine piece of engineering it seemed.Saw many gray old towns among the hills, often as gray as therocks themsleves. In sight of our hotel was the bold island ofGallinaria with a ruined tower etc. Some time before 11 a.m.corssed a stream and on our right was the R.r. bridge and just beyond thatwas a bridg of a single very wide arch; the upper surface of itgoing up to a joint- it might have been of Roman origin. Passedthrough the narrow streets of several towns and stopped to rest atFinale Marina, Hotel National, formerly Palazzo Ruffini - a finestone stair case, and large high rooms. The dining room was hung withpictures belonging to the family of our host - one portrait of a gilr hesaid was by Van dyk. An american had bought some of his oldsaints. Walked aobut eh place, quite a handsome Duomo.They are very busy enriching it now. A man opened a custom
to show us a picture crucifixion of St Andrew by Carlo Muratto. We restedabout 1 1/2 hours, reached Savone at 4 P.M. Albergo Srvizzero close to the theatrewith illuminated dials, one showing days of the month. Not open this evening.After lunch passed Noli, still surrounded by walls and towers, or at leasta long bit of wall is seen. Not far off is Isola dei Borgazzi, onlythe seoncd island we have seen. Cliffs are wonderfully fine, watervery clear and of a beautiful color. Entering Savona passed amongperhaps a mile of brick yards, where most of the emplyees were women(yesterday saw a woman making mortar, and today women and girls carryinglarge stones on their heads, men and boys were carving the same, near where largequantities of stone were being quarried and shipped to Genoa. think I may haveseen in the distance the fortifications and light house belonging to Genoa.Took a walk in Savona, a large flourishing place. Cathedral seemd very handsome, large square columns supported the vaulted roofwere annoyed by a priest who wanted to show us the antiquities, whichhad been given by Julius 2 to an older cathedral here, he having been anative of the place. Walked through the market place, and up some marblesteps into the court of a large building occupied by government officescourts etc. One church was hung in black because they were sayingprayers for the release of some one’s soul. It seemed to me as if therailroad must have been half the time in tunnels today.</p>

<p><strong>Oct. 29</strong> Thursday - Left Savona soon after 9 A.M. C. madean effort and succeded in getting a piece of Eucalyptus. Looked upsome streets where were nice rows of …. quite like Paris.Passed through Varazzo where we saw many vessels beingbuilt. Arrived at Cgoletto before noon, a dirty place, full ofbeggars, after a luncheon of fish, walk back to see the housewhere Columbus was born - a newly painted four storyhouse with inscriptions and wine shop below. A lfockof sheep came by as we were looking at it, and we sought refugein a vegetable shop opposite. The sheep helped themselves fromthe womans basket of beans. Many pretty views of hillsand villages; Genoa in sight. At Pegli we went to thePallavicini villa, were 1 1/2 hours. Were not shown the house as the familyare there. The grounds are really very interesting, cut outof the mountain side and made to look quite natural, someof the trees and shrubs brought from Savoy. We went in a boat in a stalactite cavern, among temples etc. Saw the ….of water; but were not wet. There were swings etc to amusechildren. Fine palms of different kinds, camphor tree etc.As we were about leaving the young marquis arrived with the architect. The young marquise was watching for him and came out to meet him. They had only been married twomonths. The rest of our journey was almost entirely between villas or in villages. It was twilight before we reached Genoa, in passingits fortifications had to pass through two gates. an officer cameto see if we had any thing in the carriage to declare. After passingthrough streets of what seemed magnificent palaces we arrive atGrand Hotel de Genes, 6. P. M., by the theatre, on Piazze Carlo Felice, aband of music was playing, the piazza crowded, all very gay.In entering Genova had a … view of lighthouses and shippingas well as of the fortifications on the heights.

<p><strong>Nov. 21</strong> Saturday. a beautiful day. Turned of the corso at the Piazzadi Venezia to the Piazza dil Gesu and into the church. the hall ofLapis Lazuli does not appear as large and wonderful as formerly. Wentto the Vicovaro Palace, but the Princess will not be there until the 1 Decopposite it is the Altieri Palace up the via di Ara Coeli and past the theatreof Marcellus which shows some beautiful old fleched corinthian columningnow all filled in and built upon, little shafts between them - a few stepsfarther came to a Fish Market and a sort of double Facade called the Porticoof Octavia. Driving along nearer the Tiber came to the beautiful littleTemple of Vesta now used as a church, near it is a fountain and opposite a churchSanta Maria in Cosmedin, was temple of Ceres and Porsephine, a curious oldplace. In the Portico is a huge round marble mask called “Boccadella Verita”. Out a the Porta San Paolo close to tombe of Caius Cestusof Protestant Burial Ground. Soon passed a little church on our leftsaid to mark where Peter and Paul rested in peace. A short drive to SanPaolo fuori Muri, very plain without but beautiful within. Ibelieve the handsomest church in Rome, rich in marbles whichare arranged with much taste. The walls are of bluish whitewith panels of some colored marble surrounded by a double borderof two different colors. Double aisles divided by grey granite columnsabove the columns all around a …. medallion heads of all the Popes. The rich Baldichino is suupported by four beautiful columns of Oriental Alabaster ….. by Pasha of Egypt. In eachtransept is altar of Malachite.

Woman were washing almost in it.Close to this was a small pretty white marble arch calledof Septimus Severus, a church is jammed against it.Passed house of Rienzi dilapidated, had columns withfine cornice and frieze built in it. Turn into the Ghetto; but itbeing the Jews Sabbath the shops were all closed. Afterlunch went to Vatican up the fine stairs to Raphael’sLoggia, which a dreadfully faded, very much since I sawthem, into the rooms continuing his frescoes, thoughin doing so passed through a room recently frescoedprobbly referring to the new dogma, they seemed fine. Raphaels Stanze seemed to me to have sufferred since I saw them.Into the rooms of painting - a lovely Murilla, madonna and child andSt. Catherine,  Domenichinia’s St. Jerome, Raphael’s Transfiguration,Madonna di Foligna, two lovely Persgnio’s, Santo Romualdoand some other saints in white by Andrea Sacchi very interesting.Hurried down to see the Sistine Chapel, but only to find that it closed a half hour earlier than the rest and so we were just toolate to see it. Consoled ourselves by going to the Pincian Hall.</p>

<p><strong>Nov. 22</strong> - Sunday. The day being very fine decided to go overthe Appian Way instead of going to church. Stopped first atCaracalla’s Baths  a grand ruins. Much has beenexhumed lately by Mr. Rosa. In one large room aboutthe centre twelve hundred persons could bathe at once.Could see three diamond shaped holes where the watercame in and one largeer opposite to empty the waters out.This was the Frigidarium, lso saw the caldarium, and theTepidarium, the room for gladiatorial exercise, the privatebaths etc. Saw the earthen ware pipes for heating the roomsdifferent patterns of mosaic pavement, saw very rich andbits of mosaic that have fallen from the roof representingNeptune, fish etc - the floor of the same room being in a seated pattern. Some of the floors are quite cracked and waved fromand earthquake in the fifth century. The walls are several feetthick. The building is upon a uniform plan, one half of it beinglike the other. Then continuing on the Via appian wentinto the Catacombs of St. Callisto which we had expectedto find lighted in honor of this St Cecilia’s day; but the illumination is postponed until tomorrow and we each took a taper and groped our way along the narrow mouldy passagesnarrow shelfes about four or five often in the height ofeight or ten feet on each side, and were glad in about fiveminutes to have arrived at the other end of our journey.Continued to Cecilia Metalla’s tomb, walls aboutthirty five Roman ft thick. We went a little furtherand had a very beautiful view of the aqueducts far up tothis the walls of the vineyards on either side prevent usseeing any thing. Returning stopped to see a columbariumie house under ground about thirty feet deep and about twentysquare - full of little low, broad arched niches, each one containing twovases generally round and covered by a red earthen cover someseven or eight inches in diameter. In some case the nichewas higher and the vase stood fully exposed to view. There were several busts in one columbarium. An inscription above eachniche. I put my hand in a jar and lifted up some little pieces of charredbone. In one of these buildings was a column in the centre with niches andtwo large niches where statues might have stood. On one side of itwere painted doves etc. In the afternoon to St. D… but thebest music was over before we got there.</p>

<p><strong>Nov. 23</strong> Monday - As the king was to go in state to open the house of parliament we tried to get a stand for our carriagein the Piazza Colonna but was not allowed and as it was too cold for us to stand in the street gave it up. Drove toCastellani’s to see his jewellry but he was on duty withthe king. Went to the Bankers, saw Mr. Hooker, saw whereMrs Spencer lived and looked at jewlry in that building and thenat some of Anderson’s photographs. After lunch went to seethe American church which is up to the top of the windowsred brick and white stone. Inside columns of granite with little white columns lit in and resting on rosso antico below whichis a bleuish marble. Santa Maria Maggiore, place where Pio IX is to be buried before the high altar, descending to the place by staris asbefore the balidchina at St Peters. To San Clemente which was decorated and illuminated in honor of the saint, went down to two subterranean temples one below the other, the lowest of all had been heathen and today water stood in it and dripped from the walls.The under church is plainly arched double aisles, frescoes quaint and curious, quite fresh, illuminated by candles whichdropped grease on the floors - walls etc nicely whitened.Many persons there, a curious sight. Above, the church washung in red and gold and had many worshippers. Stopped inthe coliseum they are excavating wonderfully, havegone down 25 or 30 ft. and some pavement of red and lightbrick. This will change all our long cherished memoriesof the arena indeed I do not see when there is to beany arena left. Called on Mrs. Beck in the corso.</p>

<p><strong>Nov. 24</strong> Tuesday. A cloudy day started at 10 a.m. to goto the hunt not very far from tomb of Ceclia Metalla. Onlya few carriages. About 25 persons mounted to chase the poorfox - some wore scarlet coats one was a lady. Of hounds theremight have been 30 to fifty. They went off so quietly we hardlyknew when they started, they were soon far away overthe undulating ground and we could just see them with a glass.Then left before they returned. Stopped at the Coliseum andwent to the very topmost platform of this tremendous ruin. and looked into the far depths of the present excavations. Walked allaround among the arches and after coming down to what used to beconsidered the arena we went boldly down an inclined plain inamong the recently found arches etc into two or three long passagesheading ever so far away, saw the bronze sockets in the largeflag stones in the middle of the passage where the gates aresupposed to have turned to admit the animals. Some columnsand capitols and fragments of statuary and slabs with figures engrave on them.some of them representing fighting or chase. After a late lunch tooka walk through via Babuino, Condotie and Corso home. On the oldpavement below the arena are long pieces of charred woodwith smaller crossbars of the same - very curious.</p>

<p><strong>Nov. 25</strong> - Wednesday - Took a walk with J. looking in theshop windows bought small cards for Patience, and reutrned by wayof the steps of Piazza d’Espagna and Monte Pincio. After lunch droveto the Mausoleum of Augustus which is now a modern theatre and toPiazza Navona and to see the statue of Pasquin, time, and wind and weatherhave worn the features very much off the face, went into the courtof the Farnese Palace of which the splendid travertine was stolenfrom the coliseum and theatre of Marcellus and carefully laid together hereit is a noble looking building. Drove through the ghetto where abundance of old clothes were hanging out for sale to the RomanForum but were not permitted to descend without a permitcould see extremely well from above. Walked under the arches of the temple of Peace. The stucco mouldingabove still shows the pattern distinctly in many places.Yesterday saw yellow placards pushed up announcing the timeand place and route of the funeral of F…. the artist and invitinghis friends to come to it. His remains were carried by hisfriends and before it was carried his last unfinsihed work andhis palette and brushes.</p>

<p><strong>Nov. 26</strong> Thursday. Wrote for a d…. and tooka walk this afternoon stopped in Santa Maria del Popolorich in marbles and monuments.

<p><strong>Nov. 27</strong> Friday Left Rome at 9.50 AM. White frost onthe grass. It is said that ten persons were frozen to death lastnight in the  neighborhood of Rome. The road was very interesting for some time in sight of the aqueducts and among ruins.Picturesque towns on the hills - Shepherds with their sheep. People gatheringolives. Pretty costumes. Afternoon very cloudy reached Naples about5 P.M. Hotel Etas Unies.</p>

<p><strong>Nov. 28</strong>. Saturday - not feeling satisfied with the situation of ourhotel we went in search and finally settled at Hetel de la Ville at thefurther end of the Chiara. A genuine rainy day. Next my trunkwas brought to my room last evening it was found to have beenunlocked and my … breast pin is gone.</p>

<p><strong>Nov. 29</strong>. Sunday - English church - the best and simplest serviceI have attended since leaving home. Went for a half hour to themuesum and looked at frescoes and mosaics from Herculaneum andPompeii (the so called Prahael’s Hemes were there, in color .. blackground). Drove along the Corso Victor Emanuel and down through the Mugellina and Pozilno road. Driver took us past the Grottewithout showing it. A very beautiful view and fine sun set.A wonderful number of persons dirivng. A very gay sceneladies in light silks driving up and down and … to their friends.It seems as if I never saw anything like it. Talked to mynieghbor at dinner who had been to Pompeii today and is freshfrom Egypt where he found it very warm.</p>

<p><strong>Nov. 30</strong> Monday - A rainy day, so passed it at the Museum after having risen early in the hope of going to Pompeii. The frescoes and fine mosaics from Pompeii are most interesting as also are the bronzes. Some of them are exquisite - the two Discoboli(from one of these the idea of the modern statue of Nydia seems to have been taken) the Mercury resting and the sleeping Faun (though this last seems to require some thing to rest against) the busts of Plato, Seneca and others. Many of the bronze statues have eyes made to represent life that is the white, pupil etc. Fine bronze statuettes. Some very beautiful sarcophagi in marble and fine reliefs. Looked at the rings intalgios etc, also thefine collection of Greek vases. The Etruscan vases are black figures on red ground while the Greek vases with which we are more familiar have red figures on black ground.</p>

<p><strong>Dec. 1</strong> - Tuesday - There when we hear bells tinkling and look out we either a cow with her calf going byaccompanied by some one carying a tin measure or else a number of goats passing for the same purpose. Theother day met a woman going through the street with a child’s coffin on her head. Looked in the shops for tortoiseshells and drove through the Strada del Porto, where are poor people and a market held every day in the street - the green vegetables looked very nice. In train of 12.20 to Pompeii. The guide first took into the museum where are the casts enclosing skeletons of several dead bodies look like statues when first rough hewn from the block, charred loaves of bread, various cooking utensils etc, then to the Basilica, Temple of Venus, Forum, to the two Theatres. At the house of the Baker saw the ovens, the grind stones large jar for water. Skeleton lef in one of the locales as it was found. In the Baths, the rooms are well preserved and all the arrangments can be understood, can be seen the lead pipes for bringing in the water and the places where it can be turned off, earthen pipes for carrying away the waste water. Pretty bas reliefs in stucco on walls and ceiling and often a little above the capital ofthe columns richly colored in red and blue. Where they are now excavating saw large fresco of Orpheus charming the wild beasts,and beyond it a room with bright orange colored walls, they are still excavating among the columns of the garden, we went above and saw the men working with their picks and shovels and the boys carrying the ashes and ground away in baskets on their shoulders. This gave us a view over the place. Came to the House of the Faun - in the mosaic in front of the door are the letters HAVE. It is avery large house occupying a whole block. It has two large gardens, one behind the other, in the first was found the</p>
